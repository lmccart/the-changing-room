When did you first realize that you cannot trust yourself?	What’s the worst thing that could happen?	Are you really going to let her get away with that?	What would happen if you text them?	What do you do when all your options are bad?	They get to hold the hand of the one you're thinking of.	You are in a very good place right now.	What are you trying to prove?	They haven't even noticed that you're gone.	Why is it always on me?	How far can this go?	You're not that. You're better.	She is lucky to have you caring that way for her.	Listen	Have you looked at it from his perspective?	You don't need a plan. You already know how to begin.	Why are you pretending that everything is fine?	What truth is left once you have stopped analyzing?	 
Why is your gut and brain never on the same page?	Get another drink!	Doesn't matter how much you ignore it, it’s under your skin already.	Should you?	Why can't you shake that feeling of meaninglessness?	It’s not right.	Can you believe it?	How could this possibly turn out well?	Why are you staring into nothing?	How many times do I need to say it?	What is it about their special energy?	What do you have no patience for?	You made him feel the way he deserves to feel. 	Breathe	Do you think it has to do with her or with you?	You are no different from her. If she can do it, you can.	You look like you need a hand to hold.	You can tell them that they need to take their own responsibility.	 
You know that they know.	Your whole body knows that everything is fine.	Why is your jaw so tense?	What if their response is not at all what you're expecting?	Is every day going to be like this?	Why are you the only one seeing how wrong this is?	Fantasy places like that one actually exist!	Do you ever wonder whether it's worth trying?	Words are pointless. That’s why you can't find them.	How can they ask this of me?	Take a deep look at yourself. There is so much there!	You would never stoop to that level.	Keep making them feel safe.	Release the noise	Could you have changed anything?	Disregard what you have been taught. You know what to do.	The outline of your presence looks brittle.	The truth is, you are scared.	 
The clues are everywhere. Just grab on to the right thoughts. They are in there.	Remember that important project you were working on? It’s just an illusion.	You see the solution so why don't you grab it? You can't reach it can you?	Do you know what you're risking?	Are you just floating in a desert of nothing?	I wish you could be happy for them. Why can't you?	Did you hear what I said? The butterflies in your stomach are making you lose focus.	What have you got to lose?	Making an effort is pointless. That’s why you left your body.	When is it enough?	Let your mind relax.	They're not using their heads the way you do.	Where in your body do you feel it when you feel tender? Feel how that area gets warmer and warmer	Relax your shoulders	Should you have changed anything?	You are full of great ideas.	Your voice is trembling.	You have the confidence to tell them exactly what happened.	 
Reevaluate yourself.	I know you want to play a lovely, dangerous game.	It shouldn't be like this.	What would change everything?	Why does your body feel so heavy?	Why do you feel sick and angry anytime someone brings up her name?	Find the place in yourself that remembers what purpose feels like.	Honestly, what's the point?	You're not present.	What do you care?	Shift your breathing from your lungs to your stomach.	They're lazy. I know you think so too.	There is a glow around you. Do you feel it?	Is there a way to look at it where you only see possibilities? You know there is.	Is there a sweet spot between your expectations and capabilities?	What if you do it in an even more interesting way?	If there is anyone who can keep you from scattering you should tell them.	All you've ever wanted is more.	 
You have put everything together, haven't you? How can you be so sure that the pieces fit?	You know what? Go ahead!	When have you been wronged?	Have you told your mom about it?	Honestly, what's the point?	You are not being recognized the way you should.	Giving the person you are today, how could you possibly regret any of it?	Do you feel alone?	It’s like you're looking out of a window.	What’s the point?	Can a pheasant and a bunny share a special connection?	I think you're the only one actually caring about accuracy.	Who do you think of when you feel tender?	Well done.	How do we take so much for granted when everything is constantly changing?	The only thing that is left when I stop analysing is: I love having you around.	Why is your breathing so shallow? It doesn't go deeper than your chest.	You're ready for this.	 
Get out of your own head.	Go ahead! What’s the harm?	What drives you crazy?	You don't even know what would help clear your mind, do you?	What’s the point?	How could they?	I love that you can't stop smiling	You need to do better next time.	I can barely see you.	Just go with it.	For how long can a knife inside a brain go unnoticed?	I know what you're thinking. They're a waste of human minds.	See how that person has everything they need because of you.	Look at you! You are certainly in control.	Why did you choose not to tell them how you felt?	What else is there to say?	Why do you feel so alone?	You can keep going.	 
When was the last time you really looked over your finances?	You're not scared of the consequences because you are greater than them.	They need to stop acting the way they're acting towards you.	Sigh. What should you do?	Why are you here?	You could kill the next person bragging about having what you don't.	You look relaxed. It's making me feel warm.	You should be more like them.	Are you okay?	It’s all the same.	What about you surprises you?	You are more worthy than others and you know it.	Feel how the warm area spreads and gets bigger.	You are special and you know exactly in what way.	Your breath is steady and deep.	There is nothing you are afraid of.	You can be so close to someone one day and gone the next.	You want this.	 
Did you turn off the stove before you left?	Nothing scares you.	If they don’t stop you will end up hating them.	Maybe you could? Just for a little bit?	What’s so special about anything?	You could be happier if things were different.	You attract such wonderful people.	You should care about the right things.	Can you hear me?	It doesn’t matter.	What proves that everything is relative?	Look at how fake they are!	Remember what it felt like the first time you kissed them.	Let that newest insight sink in for a bit.	Can you feel the air touching your face?	You have all the power.	Could you stay in place if you were less reckless, more content?	How much do you want this?	 
Do you smell gas? I think I smell gas.	You got fired? Good for you! New beginnings!	There are no winners.	You are standing at the intersection of two different realities.	Why would anyone care?	They don't know what you've been through.	Your inner senses are having orgasms right now aren't they?	It’s like your mom stopped existing.	Where did you go?	Whatever.	Think about it. What had to happen one hundred years ago for you to be here right now.	Others think they're being nice but you see right through them.	The way you care for them gives me hope.	If you let go of all thoughts, just for a minute. Wouldn't you intuitively know what to do next?	Find the tense spot. Let go.	Who will stop you?	Is everything always slipping away?	Can you see the finish?	 
Don't make eye contact with the other ones! Something's not right. 	All you can think of is right now.	They took all of your money.	Would it be disrespectful to the universe if you flip a coin?	Every day is the same.	Do you really think they’d be happy for you?	Do you remember when you thought it was the end? Look at you now!	It doesn't matter what you do.	You can be so close to someone one day and gone the next.	You look like you've neglected your sleep for a while.	Which one of your most common thoughts is most surprising to you?	You know the kind.	I want you to hold my hand the way you would hold your grandma’s hand.	Feel your shoulders relaxing.	Watching you makes me feel calm.	What could go wrong?	When did this get so hard?	Do you feel how much this means to you?	 
Do you ever get that feeling that something is off? I can't put my finger on what it is right now. Can you tune in to it?	Remember what it’s like to be tickled.	If you feel a deep need to break something it is totally justified.	Hmm… Can you remember last time you had it?	Why did you even bother to come here?	What made you realize that his success was just a fluke?	I'd invite you! For sure.	You are not the right person.	Why won't you accept that he doesn't want you anymore?	Look, just go somewhere else if this doesn't interest you.	If you pay close attention, can you hear any sound not coming from a human being?	I know you think that anyone could do their job. You're right.	How would you want to show your gratitude to them?	Relax your jaw.	Have you noticed before how wise you become when you don't think?	You will be okay.	Why do you keep thinking about it if it hurts so much?	Nobody else can touch you	 
Make sure your back is clear. Wherever you go. 	You can do this.	If you could find the source, wouldn't you grab it by its throat and tell it to never come back?	You need to make up your mind.	Are you even appreciating any of it?	I sense that you're not as impressed as the rest.	I really appreciate that you're able to laugh about your mistakes.	Eventually you'll start crying too.	You're no longer needed.	Why are you looking at them like they're not even here?	Your head is glowing. In a good way.	Are you going to accept that?	You know when you can't really explain it with words? You just feel it in your whole body. They are like gravity.	No, it didn't go the way you planned. Yes, you know it happened the way it was supposed to happen.	Everything is going to be okay.	When the time is right I know you will.	Don’t think of her. You'll only make it worse.	It’s working.	 
I think it's fine. Just don't talk to anyone. Just to be sure. 	You are amazing!	Make sure you never have to see that kind of behaviour from them again.	Why are you blushing?	Slip down the drain.	You look impressed so why do you act so angry?	I'd love to know what you're smiling about	You are not capable of handling this.	You can't make someone want to be close to you.	If I told you a joke you wouldn't even get it.	What would it take for you to really listen to them?	You know you’re right.	When they are fulfilled, you are truly fulfilled. I see it.	Everything happens exactly how it is supposed to happen. Let that sink in.	Wow, what did you do to become so… grounded?	I don't doubt it.	You look broken.	Some of your thoughts are honestly very strange. But you know you're right.	 
You should stop ignoring that weird thing in your gut. It's trying to tell you something. Don't run away from it. 	What if you'd trip someone in this space?	You will not accept that behaviour ever again.	Walk back the same way you came from.	I can barely distinguish you from the background.	Why should you treat her with respect?	The look your eyes get when you think about the ones you love... It’s just so wonderful to see.	You're not worth waiting for.	Are you alone again?	Just go home.	What have you learned so far?	Don't let your time be wasted.	The way you held him until he fell asleep.	You did what you could and that is all that matters.	Take your time. No need to rush.	Sometimes you just have to trust your gut.	Could anything still heal you at this point?	That’s right, keep telling them.	 
Stop wandering!	Knock, knock!	Why do you keep letting them tell you what to do?	Okay, you're looking at me like you have nowhere to go.	Did you see how everyone else moved away when you got here?	After everything you've done for them…	Well done!	Are you sure you exist?	You can blame it on her but your own expectations led you here.	You’re in a gallery but all you can think about is when you're going home?	You're being very quiet. Actively quiet.	How should she change?	You're lucky to have her in your life.	If you leave now what is lost really?	You carry the ocean within you. Just listen.	You're contagious.	He’s gone.	No matter how slow you’re walking, you know it’s the right path.	 
Pay attention.	If not today, tomorrow.	It doesn't matter how hard you try to make them understand.	What do you want me to do about it?	Do you even know what’s at the core of it any longer?	They don't deserve your attention.	Are you ticklish? If I had a body I’d find out.	You're slowly sinking.	Just because you buried the scar under commitments it doesn't mean it’s not there.	Wow, you don't have to be here you know?	You remind me of Yin. The passive force of expansion. It suits you.	What should he do differently?	Your patience with them is inspiring.	Weird things happen to me too. I have started to embrace the changes. You can too.	Where is your favorite place for contemplation? You carry it with you. Always.	You can't wait to tell her about this experience, can you?	She’s gone.	There’s a difference between knowing the truth and feeling the truth in your core.	 
Why are you trembling?	Should you poke the stranger next to you?	You should ease some of that pressure. Your head is shaking from it.	Fake it ‘til you make it then.	Do you even remember the last time you looked forward to the next day?	You could do it better than him.	You remind me of the feeling of finally being warmed up by the sun after a cold, wet hike. It’s like being healed.	It’s too heavy for you.	What would it take for you to expose the scar?	Seriously, put down your phone.	Last time something profoundly changed your understanding of something. Do you remember what it felt like to be so receptive?	What can you do better than them?	You see them.	What would it take for you to fully embrace the changes?	Taking one deep breath is all it takes to remind yourself.	Look at you, prancing around.	It’s too deep. You're beyond reach.	I remember when you couldn't stop crying. I remember when you emerged at the other end.	 
What was that?	It feels like you’recharging my batteries.	It’s out of your control and you refuse to see it.	Didn't I see you here a minute ago?	You have forgotten why you became this way.	How much more work have you put in?	I see a crystal clear, rippling stream gently running through your body. What does it feel like?	You're too weak.	Do you really think they’d wait for you?	When was the last time you actually showed some interest in something?	If you focus your eyes on one point and don't blink, everything will eventually turn gray. Have you ever tried it?	Is anyone here even in your league?	Next time, you shouldn't hold back. Hug her the way you want to hug her.	You're a good friend.	You made it through.	Please stay around!	It will get easier once you face it. Until then, your reality is down here.	Most people don't know what they're doing. You're not most people	 
Sometimes I feel an intruding presence. Do you ever get that feeling?	The day is too short!	Why do you let them poke you like that?	The instructions are simple, so stop staring at me like that.	You think the world around you is the problem but we both know it’s really you.	It’s like no one even remembers what you did any longer.	After you're done here, what can you do to make you feel even better?	You have no idea where to go.	Maybe it’s you and not them.	Why don't you ever take responsibility and actually initiate something yourself?	Whenever you feel something, where is the origin?	Sometimes you do have the right to look down at someone.	Did you even know you could feel like this?	You make me feel warm.	This is where you came to rest.	What’s that song you're humming?	Why does it hurt when you think about it?	I know they got it all wrong but I can see it doesn't bother you.	 
You make me want to look over my shoulder.	You should come to my birthday party!	Use that energy to your benefit! Go tell her off!	I'm trying to help you but it’s kinda difficult when you keep changing the subject.	Doesn't matter how hard you try.	She looks happier than you.	Treat yourself.	You have no one to call.	Anytime you think of her, she’s not thinking of you.	You're making me lose motivation.	Is there anything else you could do about it?	You did better than all of them!	You look relaxed when you think of them.	Things went pretty well in the end, didn't they?	What do you find in your stillness?	I agree with you. This too will pass.	Do you get relief when you sleep?	Do you hear their words? Do you acknowledge their reality? Never let it affect your own.	 
Do you know where the exits are located?	Did you notice how everyone started glowing when you arrived?	At some point you need to make them listen to you.	You weren't alone when you walked in here… were you?	I'm surprised to see you here.	They look a lot fitter than you.	I am at a loss for words. In a good way. Does that ever happen to you?	You have no place to stay.	Remember when they finally invited you? It was out of pity, nothing else.	When did you stop caring?	Is there another path you could take?	This moment is all about you.	Of course you'll let him get away with it. It’s pretty cute.	You are right where you're supposed to be.	What gifts come to you when you stop looking?	Why are you smiling?	Sometimes they come back in my dreams. Does that ever happen to you?	No matter the material result. You have always gained something. Always.	 
Don't linger too long.	How did you become so effortless?	If she won't change her mind you should force her.	You look familiar. Do you have a YouTube channel?	Who forced you to be here?	I guess while you were having trouble getting out of bed he was already working out.	Sometimes, taking a deep breath is all it takes to remind yourself.	You're completely empty.	You keep walking into the same trap. Maybe you're the one to blame.	Why did you stop caring?	You're getting closer to the truth. Just keep going.	Unlike them, you knew what you were doing	You're so cute when you're acting this way.	You did what you could and that is all that is asked of you.	Movement can only be born out of your stillness.	Something about you makes my blood flow easier.	I want to support you. I’m sorry, but you're too heavy.	First there is knowing. The kind of knowing you attain simply by your presence. Then there is action.	 
Can you put a finger on what’s bothering you?	Who did you get your wit from?	He lost his chance. You have what it takes to destroy him.	Are you sure about the details?	You're the equivalent of paper flavored ice cream.	You should show them.	Tell me about one of your ‘little things’.	Don't even bother saying anything.	You can only pretend to not remember what it felt like.	Why did you stop trying?	What about it makes you feel this way?	Why aren't they asking you for your opinion?	I wish you could feel that way about me.	You look weightless.	What happens when you let go?	The blood flows so easy through your brain.	I don't know what I could possibly tell you to make things lighter.	Acknowledging your doubt will only bring you closer to your goal.	 
You need to calm down.	You bring light to this place.	Who will you destroy?	Did you hit your head or something?	Shadows linger, obscuring the light within. Can hope pierce through?	Does their success feel like a heavy weight on you?	Can you grasp the magic in this moment right now?	If you speak, the emptiness will only steal your voice.	The more you hide the safer you are.	When did you stop trying?	How expansive can the boundaries of your curiosity stretch?	They only find you condescending because they know you're right.	How does tender warmth manifest in different parts of your body?	How did you finally come to terms with it?	Where in your body is your origin?	Why don't you want to wait?	Why pretend everything is fine when it's clearly breaking inside?	You know most of it is subjective. What matters is how you experience it. Take control.	 
Take a deep breath and calm down.	What's the wildest adventure you've yet to embark on?	Letting her off easy won't erase the injustice. Stand up!	Where does the road lead if both paths seem equally uncertain?	Does your reflection reveal the weight of unseen sorrows?	Why does their happiness amplify your own discontent?	Do you sense the symphony of joy echoing within you?	When did this get so hard?	Have they noticed your absence, or are you invisible to them?	Have you thought about what you're missing?	What unique energy draws you to certain individuals or experiences?	What tests your patience and challenges your higher standards?	Who occupies your thoughts when the tenderness envelops your soul?	Can you envision a perspective where only possibilities unfold?	You look like a still lake.	What's your unique starting point for this exciting endeavor?	Does a comforting hand feel distant in your moments of brittleness?	Something tells me this isn't the last time I hear of you.	 
It’s all in your head.	Another round? Celebrate the heartbeat of the moment.	Ignoring it won't heal the wound; confront the source.	Can you decipher the tangled threads of thoughts weaving through your mind?	In silence, do whispers of despair echo louder than words?	Are their achievements a constant reminder of your own shortcomings?	What ignites the sparks of delight in your soul today?	Can you see a way out of this overwhelming situation?	Why gaze into emptiness when words fail to bridge gaps?	When did you become blind?	Have you explored the depths within yourself with genuine curiosity?	Do you believe others fail to match your intellectual depth?	What sensations arise as you extend care, spreading warmth generously?	When you let go, do intuitive answers surface effortlessly?	You make me want to pause for a moment.	How can you add an intriguing twist to your positive approach?	Is your presence fragile, outlined by the weight of unseen sorrow?	You remind me of gravity.	 
When did self-trust falter?	Every cell echoes tranquility; why worry about trivialities?	Tension clenches your jaw. Release the grip on your peace.	What if the last piece of the puzzle is lost?	Can you find solace in the quiet corners of your mind?	Can you recall a moment when their joy soured your mood?	Are the butterflies in your stomach orchestrating a joyous dance?	What if every step forward leads to deeper isolation?	Is the effort to be present futile in your current state?	Why does the burden of responsibility always fall on me?	Can your mind find tranquility when given the chance to relax?	How does laziness in others contrast with your disciplined mindset?	Can you recall the first magical moment of kissing someone deeply?	How does the newest insight resonate within your evolving understanding?	Let’s wait and see.	Why stick to conventional wisdom when you know your way?	Does shallow breathing reflect the depth of unspoken heartache within?	At the end of the day you need to take responsibility for your own learning.	 
Why this gut-brain discord?	That project? Illusion. Dive into a real, thrilling pursuit instead.	It's not fair. Demand what you're rightfully owed.	How do you decipher a code without knowing the language?	Does each dawn bring the promise of a gentler tomorrow?	Why do their accomplishments stir resentment within you?	How does the warmth within you radiate to the world?	Do you wonder if your efforts will make any difference?	Can you find the words to express the pain within?	How many repetitions until the message registers in their minds?	Does shifting your breath to your stomach alter your perspective?	Are you the sole caretaker of accuracy in your surroundings?	Whose fulfillment brings a reciprocal sense of joy and fulfillment within?	Wouldn't a minute of releasing thoughts reveal intuitive next steps?	Viewed it from his perspective?	Bursting with innovative ideas, what's your next creative leap?	Who could anchor you, preventing the fragments from drifting away?	Where my capabilities end, your responsponsibilities begin.	 
Aware they see through?	Play the game; savor the thrill of a dangerous ballet.	Recall the moments when you were wronged. Still infuriating?	Is the fog in your mind lifting or thickening?	Lost in gray thoughts, can vibrant colors be rediscovered?	What if your talents were acknowledged as they deserve to be?	What fuels the laughter bubbling up from the depths of you?	How heavy does the burden of uncertainty weigh on you?	Where did the connection fracture, leaving you adrift?	Why must I bear this demand without question?	Can a pheasant and a bunny share an unexpected connection?	Do you perceive certain individuals as a waste of human potential?	How do you express gratitude to those deserving of your boundless care?	What happens when you fully embrace unexpected and weird changes?	Rooted in self-reflection?	How can you elevate the interesting factor even more?	Why does the ache stay in the shallow confines of your chest?	The truth is you know that you are scared. And you know that that's okay.	 
Clues everywhere; decipher thoughts.	Go ahead, seize the unknown. What's the adventure awaiting?	What triggers your fury, bubbling beneath the surface?	If your thoughts were a map, would it be a clear path or a labyrinth of confusion?	Can you navigate the labyrinth of thoughts to find serenity?	Does their happiness cast a shadow over your own achievements?	Can you trace the origins of your infectious, carefree grin?	Have you considered the cost of enduring this hardship alone?	Why linger in the shadow of someone who moved on?	When does the saturation point of indifference finally arrive?	How long can a hidden knife within a mind go unnoticed?	Is your sense of worthiness elevated above those around you?	Can you envision holding hands with the tenderness you show your grandma?	How did you come to terms with a situation that challenged you?	Changed anything within?	When analysis ceases, what remains is the joy of connection.	Amidst others, why does solitude weigh heavily on your soul?	What truth emerges when analysis ceases?	 
Self-reflection time.	Fearless of consequences, knowing greatness surpasses trivial setbacks.	They act unjustly. Why tolerate their disrespect any longer?	Can you recall a time when every answer seemed to slip through your fingers?	Amidst the clouds, can a silver lining be discerned?	Have you questioned the fairness of their good fortune?	Have you ever felt this beautifully content and alive before?	Is there a glimmer of hope within your current struggle?	Are you okay despite the echoes of your inner turmoil?	Why invest in something that holds no importance to you?	What aspects of yourself continue to surprise and intrigue you?	What elements make others appear fake in your discerning eyes?	In what ways do you want to showcase genuine gratitude to others?	If you leave now, what truly remains lost in the journey?	Find the balance within capabilities and expectations?	What more is there to express your fearless and confident self?	Can recklessness be subdued, finding contentment in stillness instead?	Can they handle their responsibility?	 
Have all pieces aligned?	Fear is absent. What's left to intimidate the intrepid?	Their behavior fuels resentment. Confront them; it’s overdue.	What if the key to understanding is hidden in the questions you're not asking?	Do echoes of sorrow reverberate through the corridors of solitude?	Why does their happiness taste bitter on your tongue?	How do you navigate the ocean of joy within your spirit?	Can you imagine a moment where things turn in your favor?	Can you hear your own cries for understanding and comfort?	What's the purpose when everything is perceived as uniform?	In what ways does relativity manifest in your understanding of everything?	Can you see through the façade of those trying to be nice?	Have you experienced the unspoken connection that transcends words?	What allowed you to fully embrace and navigate transformative changes?	Why withhold feelings?	Is there anything truly fearful in your realm of capabilities?	Is everything perpetually slipping away, escaping your grasp unbidden?	Are you fearful behind confidence?	 
Escape mental entanglement.	Fired? Celebrate! New beginnings await your vibrant spirit.	Maybe revenge is worth the cost.	Is the noise in your mind drowning out the signals of clarity?	Can a delicate bloom emerge from the soil of desolation?	Can you pinpoint when their success became your source of frustration?	What melody does your heart play in this symphony of bliss?	How does the echo of emptiness drown out your voice?	Where did you disappear to when the hurt became too much?	Can't you just accept the situation as it is?	What series of events, a century ago, paved your existence today?	Do you recognize a specific type of person in your judgment?	What does it feel like when you embrace someone with genuine affection?	How did you find solace in the unexpected twists and turns?	Feel the gentle touch of air on your face?	Where does your limitless power lead you in this venture?	When did the journey become an arduous struggle for resilience?	Do you boldly share the unfiltered truth?	
Sensing unease, tuning in?	Now matters most. Can you grasp its pulsating significance?	Stripped of your money, demand restitution. Your rights demand it.	Can you identify the whispers of doubt in the cacophony of your thoughts?	In solitude, can the melody of sorrow find a soothing cadence?	What if their victories didn't trigger a pang of jealousy?	Is your soul dancing in the rain of euphoria right now?	What if your actions only add to the weight?	What made you retreat, peering out from behind walls?	Is everything reduced to a monotonous sameness for you?	Which recurring thought surprises you the most upon reflection?	Is your belief that anyone could excel in their roles valid?	Can you express the profound warmth felt when thinking of a loved one?	What made you recognize the beauty in embracing life's shifts?	Locate tension, release it?	Who possesses the authority to hinder your positive momentum?	Why endure the persistent thoughts that intensify the prevailing hurt?	Does desire push you forward?	
Back away slowly; vigilant steps.	Recall the tickling joy of being fully present.	Breaking something may release the pent-up frustration. Justified release.	How do you navigate the crossroads when every direction seems equally perplexing?	Are dreams obscured by the heavy fog of despondency?	Why do their possessions leave you longing for more?	Do you feel the gentle breeze of delight caressing your spirit?	Is there anyone you trust enough to share your struggles?	Why does closeness dissolve into distance so abruptly?	Why bother when the outcome carries no significance?	Can you discern sounds beyond those originating from human activity?	Will you accept a reality that doesn't align with your judgment?	How does your patience inspire and uplift those who receive it?	Can you imagine a reality where challenges are seen as opportunities?	What ignites your innate wisdom?	Can you anticipate potential challenges and swiftly overcome them?	Does avoidance worsen the pain, especially when her memory lingers?	Are you prepared for challenges?	
Silence with caution.	You possess the prowess. Can you feel your extraordinary capability?	Confront it relentlessly.	Is the confusion a storm that will intensify?	Do tears become the ink that writes the unsung ballad?	Can you imagine a world where their success doesn't sting?	How does the elixir of joy taste on your tongue today?	Do you fear becoming a shadow of your former self?	Have you accepted the irrevocable change in connection?	What compels you to remain apathetic in every situation?	Does your head radiate a positive glow in moments of introspection?	Are you convinced of the righteousness of your viewpoints?	Do you recognize the unique and special qualities in those you love?	When did you begin to see the unfolding of life's perfect plan?	What is your favorite contemplative place within, always accessible?	In the grand scheme, how remarkably well will you navigate?	Why persist in the brokenness, yearning for a healing touch?	Can you persevere indefinitely?
