People like vulnerability but all I ever wanted to be was cool.	But I liked it.	I'm not really in a rush but if it wasn't for them I could be getting there faster. The two of them are taking up the whole sidewalk and they are walking slower than my grandma. Maybe if I walk louder they'll notice me. I loudly clear my throat. Nothing. Who do they think they are?	I just came across that photo again. It happens on accident every so often, usually when I'm feeling moist down. Years ago, I read Jesse's diary. I instantly regretted it. I never did it again after that. It was all my worst fears. Everything I dislike about myself was right there on the pages. My stubbornness, my destructive belief in the unrealistic. I took a photo because I knew if I didn't I would blow it up even worse in my head. But now I stumble upon that photo randomly in my computer every few years and I'm drowned in doubt again.	I feel like I'm just pouring all of my energy into a void on my computer screen desperately hoping if I do it long enough something will happen.	She gets to hold his hand. To make him laugh. To fall asleep on his shoulder. It's not right. Why am I the only one feeling this way? Nowhere in the universe is this right.	This morning I dropped the jar with ground coffee. It got all over the kitchen floor. This was before I even had a chance to load the coffee machine. It made me laugh out loud. Didn't bother me one bit. It was like being hit in the face without feeling any pain. Only the surprise was left. I must be in a very good place in my life right now.	I am 63 years old suddenly living with my mom again, all my frustrations come flooding back. I say, “Don't you remember how Dad terrorized us? Don't you remember how we would all hide in our rooms anytime he was home? Don't you remember how the house would literally shake when he screamed? Why didn't you protect us? Why did you listen to him? Why didn't you do anything? Why did you move away as soon as I had a baby? Didn't you want to know your family? Why didn't you do anything with your life? Why did you just leave?” She is 90 now.	The soft wind brings a distorted sound of chatter from the cabin up on the hill.	I stole a car. It started as a joke with my friend, then it was a dare. I'm not a daredevil. I don't know why I did it, it's like, I skipped the moment where I decided whether it was a good or bad idea, and suddenly I was just doing it. Stealing my teacher's keys off his desk when he was at the back of the room. I was supposed to ride the bus home from school with my brother and when he met me I just said come on and he followed me to the parking lot, I saw the car, and we got in. He was confused and I just acted like it was normal and he went along with it. Can you play some music? I asked to distract him.	This man in china realized he had had a knife stuck in his brain for four years.	I would never do that. I would never be that selfish, that self-concerned.	I don't understand but I know and trust that you have your reasons. I will still be here.	I hear a woodpecker. I try to locate the bird through the pecking sound. There he is. The tree he's sitting in is only a few feet away. I walk up to it and put my ear against the trunk. The bark is cold and rough against my ear. I can feel every peck on my skin. The pecking sounds much deeper through the trunk.	I mean … worst thing that could happen is that I lose my job. I'll get another one. People have done similar things before.	When we got together we were young. There was nothing we were afraid of. It was a constant contest to prove we each had more in us than the other. The world is ours. We can't die. What could go wrong?	My mom pulled up as the police were cuffing me and pushing me into the back of the car. My mom was reaching through the window trying to wipe my tears with a kleenex.	Whatever this is, it makes me happy. I don't need it to be anything else. I don't need you to act in a certain way, I don't need you to tell me anything. I am tired of trying to have a plan. The only thing that is left when I stop analysing is: I love having you around. What else is there to say?
I hope that it was ok. I hope that I was not too much, and I hope that I was enough.	sharp and hazy at the same time	Stop chewing so loudly. Stop chewing. Stop chewing. Stop. Chewing.	I wondered what my purpose was. If I was just distracting from that, trying to insert myself into some place I didn't belong. There was so little to offer when you already had built all this. As my anxiety grew, again and again I had to remind myself that this is not meant to be about me.	I don't know what's happening now. I felt like I had been slowly dying over months, years maybe. Everything was at a standstill. A friend was so concerned last month he showed up frantic at my home thinking I would kill myself. I hadn't been planning to, but his visit got me thinking. Maybe that's a real idea on the table. But don't worry, I couldn't do that to the people around me. It just feels so good to google.	I wish I could be happy for him but the truth is I can't. Which is making me feel even worse. While he's been hanging out with the right people I've been thinking about the bigger picture. The final goal. I guess the goal is just an excuse for them to be important. I honestly thought the goal itself was important	His last wish was to pass away in the house he had built for his family fifty years earlier. He did not need any tubes and his wife was a nurse back in the days so they let us move him home. He could have taken his last breath from a hospital bed but we got to bring him home. He took his last breath looking over the same fields he looked over as a toddling little boy.	Then we were pulling out of the lot. I hadn't driven before, drivers ed started in a few months. But I'd seen friends do it. I was being extra careful. Put my blinkers on. turned left. and i was doing it, everything was fine. And then suddenly, a car coming head on. I realized I was in the wrong lane. I thought it was a two way road but it was one way. I didn't know what to do. I drove toward the left and the oncoming car drove to their right. Everything happened in slow motion. My brother was screaming. I was silent watching us crash head on into each other.	They haven't even noticed that I'm gone.	I want to be a custom order. Delivered to your front door. I will do anything you want.	An area in my mind cracks open and reveals a space with sparkling white light. There is an urge to enter that space and see where it goes. From here I cannot see the horizon.	I don't understand how people can go out without masks shrugging I'm not afraid of getting sick. How can they care so little for others? How can they be so ignorant of your own effect on others?	There is literally nowhere else I want to be.	I don't say anything. I don't feel like I should say anything even though she has been silent for a moment now. She looks slightly troubled but I can feel that she is comfortable. I put my hand on hers. She nods and sighs. We just sit there. I feel so close to her.	“But what are you going to do if they catch you?” Hmm … I hadn't thought about that. It just kinda feels like they won't. If they do I'll handle it when it happens.	I just open my mouth and let it come out. I'm witnessing along with everyone else. They lose control over their faces as they watch stunned. I feel a flash of power. I do it again. What will they do? Nobody seems to be able to stop me. Least of all me.	I have never felt so… ashamed is not a strong enough word. I couldn't believe this was me.I couldn't believe I could disappoint my family so instantly and completely like that.	Look, I get that some of you find this confusing. But at the end of the day you need to take responsibility for your own learning. Where my capabilities end, your responsponsibilities begin. I cannot give you everything in a tidy list. That's not how life works.
The microwave is gone. He stole my microwave. I am reaching for all thoughts containing clues. Trying to put it all together. Why in the world would he steal my microwave? My gut has been telling me “he is not to be trusted” while my brain has been saying “you need to be more understanding”. If his behaviour is this irrational I obviously cannot trust him. What else has he stolen? I reevaluate our whole relationship. Each action that I previously saw at the border of distrust and understanding is now clearly on the distrust side. He has been lying about everything this whole time. I look at the shelf where the microwave used to be. There it is. Still standing on the shelf. No one has stolen it. Why in the world would my mind make up something like that? Am I the one needing evaluation?	We drove home without speaking.	I knew it was going to rain. Why didn't I bring my umbrella? My hair is going to get my desk wet.	All I'm left with now is that photo, warning me. I should have listened. I never change. I can't delete it.	I put all of this effort into it and now you want me to stop? Like I don't have better things to do?	I can't really put my finger on it. Every time someone brings up her name I feel sick and angry. It's not intimidation. It's more a sense of … not being recognized. Sure, she's skilled at what she's doing but just because she was on TV doesn't mean she's the best. They can't tell a good fighter from a bad one. It's all about who gets the most attention. They have no idea what I have accomplished. How could they?	I had not heard from him in three days. I knew bombings were pretty unusual but they did occur in the area. Of course bombs were the only thing I could think of. When he finally called from an unknown number hearing his cheery voice almost felt like being mocked. How incredibly sweet to be mocked by that voice.	I feel so many things I don't even know where to begin right now. There aren't enough words.	I'm staring at the floor.	I am tired. I don't need more complicated relationship bullshit. We didn't want kids. We didn't even want pets.	She seems relieved. It must be since she learned how to walk. I'd be relieved too. All of a sudden she doesn't have to rely on us to get her everything. Any time she walks somewhere her arms are raised to the sky and she makes a sound somewhere in between a scream of joy and giggles.	So often I just think in my head do better. Be better. Come on.	I give her some space but make sure that she can still see me.	My neck is aching from my posture but I have accepted it. In this position he can reach my cheek over the side rails of the hospital bed. His hand feels fragile and warm. He is barely in his body any longer but he is looking into my eyes like he for the first time can see all that I am. There is nothing but love in his eyes.	No, no, no, don't call her. The baby is fine, believe me. She's sleeping. The babysitter is watching TV. I just know. My whole body knows that everything is fine.	I really thought I would learn some actual skills from that talk. But it turned out that most of what they were able to accomplish was done by pure luck. Things just kind of aligned as they moved forward. I don't actually need a plan! I can just start with what I have now. And the rest will … I don't know but I look forward to seeing where I'll end up!	I want to reverse time and start over. It felt like we always had a special connection and I had just broken it. I thought I was the kind of person that didn't fuck up. I didn't even know who I was in that moment anymore.	The truth is I am scared. I should tell someone. If I can tell myself, I can tell someone else.
I look back at the same actions now reevaluating myself. I need to be more understanding and trusting.	He reached over and grabbed my wrist.	Just order your latte already! Are you not aware of the line behind you?	If I text her she could either not get back at all, in which case I'd know. Or she could reply. Sounding happy or dismissive. Or maybe indifferent. If I don't text her I can keep on living in my fantasy world. I wish I knew what I'm really risking.	Why don't you ever tidy anything up? Look at this mess. There's stuff everywhere. Can you make yourself useful and put some of it away? Not over there!	From where I'm waiting on the bus I can see the outdoor seating and all the happy visitors. It's the fanciest one out of our not so fancy local bars. I wish I had the time and money. I wish I was one of them. I'm sure they're complaining about simple stuff. Like deadlines. Or babysitters. I wish I had deadlines to complain about.	I remember what it felt like having knots in my chest. I notice the sensation of their absence. It makes it easy to breathe. There are no shadows in here where anything can hide. Everything is evenly lit. The negative is hoovering like transparent shadows. Making the positive appear so much clearer.	I need to do better next time. She always washes the dishes before I even realize they need washing. They all think I'm lazy but I just don't notice it. I don't know how to be like them. I don't know how to care about the right things. I need to do better.	Words are pointless.	I knew it would be too much for me, for us, to handle. I have enough going on with all my family. I need a lot of space. I'm busy. I never wanted to think about babies. I am exhausted.	It's not so much about what he is saying. It's about his energy. Something about chopsticks? I'm not sure about the words. I am engulfed by his movements. His fingers have transported to the actual time of when it happened. They are proving the relativity of everything. There is no need to hope that he won't stop because it simply isn't a realistic continuation.	I've been trying to practice patience. It doesn't come easily to me. My mom had no patience. She would scream at us anytime we messed up. Any mistake she treated as a personal offence. Constantly reminding myself people mess up sometimes.	She had wanted an RC car ever since we were kids. I don't know why our parents never gave her one. Or why she never got herself one when we got older. She still mentions it every once in a while. I surprised her a Wednesday after work. Just a normal day like any other. She was surprised to see me, in a confused and low-key happy kind of way. The look on her face when she opened the present… It still makes me warm to think about it. She deserves to always feel that way.	I sense each punch as soon as she starts throwing them. She slightly pumps her left hand. I catch the incoming jab. I throw a counter jab before she moves. It lands. I move my head. She hesitates. I feint a jab. Her hands move up. I shift level and shoot. A bump in my shoulder as I make contact. A second bump as we hit the ground.	What if this and what if that. What if nothing? What if the apocalypse gets here before the end of the day?	When my dad realized all his neighbors had moved to a better neighborhood he was happy for them. Even though he had forgotten to pay his part of the gambling share and was excluded from the winnings. He was genuinely happy for them. That's the kind of person I want to be.	Don't ask me how I'm doing was all I could think of. I kept my head low as I passed them. Didn't even nod. Didn't look back. I couldn't look back. If I look back now, I'll break.	I had a great time too! But there is something missing for me. I can't really put my finger on it. I guess it's just a chemistry thing. I really wish you all the best though.
If anyone asks me what I think about it they'll immediately realize that I have no idea what I'm talking about. They'll start wondering why I was even allowed to be here in the first place. The woman in the gray button up shirt is already thinking it. During the introductions she gave me a look that said “How predictable. Not capable of forming thoughts with any kind of substance.” Why did they accept me if I don't belong here? Maybe they always do that to one person. As a game. I should never have applied.	vaguely felt his body press into mine	A vibrating sensation in my solar plexus. It is trying to move up towards my chest and get out through my throat.	You already bought the dress?? I mean that changes everything. I think. How much did you spend? Have you told your mom? Are you really sure you're going? I am not coming with you. Too much drama. Plus I'd have to buy a dress myself. Are we bringing dates? Gaahh, why are you doing this to me?	If we get a cat it's not like there's only going to be cuddles. It'll be weeks of peeing everywhere before it learns where to pee. And sometimes they choose to pee in your shoes just to annoy you. Believe me it'll be more work than cuddles.	Sure, we're all affected. But some people live in huge houses with loving families. Some of us are stuck in small apartments. With passive aggressive roommates and their leaching partners. Goddamnit I could kill the next person posting a picture of their beautiful backyard.	Noticing the absence of a negative cause or consequence where it just as well could have been.	Her mom left in a hurry just when I started feeding her. I tried to distract her. Instead of paying attention to me or the food she's reaching towards the front door behind her and screams. It's like mom stopped existing through some kind of evil magic. The door was the last thing that got to experience her alive. “Sweetie, look over here!” Nothing. I brush her cheek. “It'll be okay, I promise. Mommy misses you too and she's coming back soon.” The screaming only intensifies. Sometimes she cries in a way that makes me think she just needs attention. This is the kind of crying that comes from a deep, inconsolable place of loss. I pick her up and rock her. “I love you. It's okay.” It doesn't matter what I do. I am not the right person. Her face is red and wet. My ears hurt. Eventually I start crying too. This is not how it should be handled but I am not capable.	Making an effort is pointless.	Why is it always on me? How many times do I need to say it? There is so much work to be done, and then as I'm doing it, it's just constant pushback. The deepest parts of their egos unconsciously react and the attacks become personal. How can they ask this of me? I'm so tired of trying. Of feeling so utterly ineffective.	Am I running away from something? It feels like I should be more hurt than I am. I look at where the hurt should be. There is a stable wall. Is it stable because of strong denial or because profound self respect? It needs deeper investigation.	I would never do that. I would never be that selfish, that self-concerned.	The way she inhales in short bursts. The same way she does when she has stopped crying. I want to caress her cheek and forehead but I'm scared of waking her up. I put the tip of my finger in her chubby little palm and stroke the back of her hand with my thumb. I will never let anything hurt you. I will always keep you safe.	The sound of a bonfire	You trees have never heard the words project manager have you? It's just a thing that humans made up to get the illusion that their projects are being managed. The projects are pretty much illusions too. Anyway, they're pointless out here. It's just you and me. And the wind.	All these rules. I wasn't really aware that they existed. Even less that I was living my life according to them. When I saw what she had done I was amazed. A completely new way of thinking. I could do that too! I can disregard what I have been taught. I can do it my way.	I was nineteen years old. I hadn't seen my family in six months. While they were waiting for me at the airport, I was stranded at a different airport in a different country. Without a cellphone. With a fever. I asked a lady at the info desk if she could please help me call my mom. She said no. I didn't say anything. I didn't make a face. But I couldn't stop the tears falling down my cheeks.	My boss asked me why I didn't show up at work yesterday. I told him exactly what happened. I went to disneyland.
I don't think I'll go back. I know you think he's a nice guy but it got really uncomfortable when we were alone. No, it wasn't anything he did or said. Maybe the way he said it? I'm not taking any risks.	But I remember his eyes.	Then George Floyd was murdered. The energy was so intense, it rippled and radiated in waves of anger and grief. And suddenly, as I was sitting with it all and standing in front of those burning cars, everything in me ripped open and I remembered we are alive. I haven't been able to stop shaking since. For a minute I felt everything was on the table. I'm not fucking letting go of that.	I really thought the cool breeze of the ocean would help clear my mind. Bring the dust with it. Leave only the important parts. The parts still affected by gravity. It didn't. The dust is as heavy as anything else. I drag my finger through it to at least get a glimpse of the surface. The dust slowly finds its way back to cover it. Sigh. What do I do?	What's the use? It's going to be loud. The food is usually not even that good. If I stay home I can at least eat my boring food in silence.	All I ever wanted was a my little pony. At this time I didn't know it was possible to dislike someone just because they had something I didn't. I didn't feel happy for her either. I just felt a lack. A proof that I could be happier if things were different.	Noticing the presence of a positive cause or consequence where it was not	We're going on a field trip after lunch. We're big enough to take the bus on our own. It'll probably take us thirty minutes to get to the sports venue from our school. It feels like a big responsibility. A little bit scary even. The cafeteria is serving a special kind of christmas lunch today. Which means that all kids are wanting seconds and the food is running out. To be more precise, the food runs out just before my turn. While I have no choice but to wait, my classmates finish their meals and leave for the bus. I'm not worth waiting for. I don't finish my food. I don't go on the field trip. It feels like I'm not sure I exist.	I'm staring at the floor but I'm floating above the roof.	The blur of faces, language barriers, can't fall asleep, can't wake up, dozing off with coffee in hand. The exhausted panic waking up in the dark, rushed 5am walk to the bus, the train, security, flight, layover, second flight, customs, train, seventh floor walkup. I'm laying on the floor.	Every time I try to pierce the cocktail tomato with my fork it slips away. I take a deep breath. Let my shoulders relax to a lower position. My breathing shifts from my lungs to my stomach. I breathe out as I push the fork through the tomato. Success. My body follows my mind and my mind follows my body. Why do we even call it by two different names?	How can they be so ignorant of your own effect on others?	I don't know this person. I have never seen him before. His eyes are tired, sad and loving at the same time. Like he has come to terms with his life's situation. It won't improve but he doesn't complain as long as he is helping. He is sitting in front of me and as the subway train shakes so does he. I wish he was standing so I could offer him my seat. I hope he's going home to someone who loves and takes care of him.	The sound of the wind in a forest	Ooops! I guess the toilet broke. Lol! This weekend is going to turn out a bit different than we imagined. Stinkier for sure!	He had no legs. Not even his thighs had been saved. But his hands were the strongest I have ever experienced. The other wrestlers were having serious issues controlling him on the mat. They tried to look cool about it but I could see their frustration and amazement. I remember realizing how small my problems suddenly seemed. I told myself that I definitely both can and will work through it. I still find more of my inner strength whenever I think of him.	There is no energy to spare for any muscles. And still everything is trembling. Especially my chest. It's a soft, fast paced trembling. Its rhythm could easily be disrupted. If it is, my existence will be flooded.	I am spending more time at school than I have to because I don't want to come home to this any longer. I don't know what to do but I can't go on like this. We need a change. We need a serious change.
There is absolutely no one on the streets except for me and the man walking on the other side of the road. We are walking in opposite directions. 	I remember breathing.	Oh my god! She's not even looking our way. Hellooooo! You need to move your car. Your car! You need to move it! What ... Where is she going? Are you kidding me?!! Hey!! HEY!!! Oh hell no, she is not getting away. I slam the car door behind me as I almost run towards her with heavy determined feet.	I'm super comfortable right here. But I am getting bored. Maybe I'll join them for a little bit. Or I could tell them I'm not feeling well. I guess there's no reason to lie but I don't want them to think I'm being lazy.	My inner sensations cannot withstand the gray, gravel like forces of the outside world.	A piece of my chest is missing. I look for it and find it in someone else. They think it belongs with them. No matter how hard I try to grab it and bring it back I can't even reach it.	You can only truly be thankful if you understand what could have been instead.	I am trying to help him see things from a positive perspective. It comes off like I'm not taking him seriously. I am. But I don't want to be dragged down so I'm trying to lift him up. We're slowly sinking. He's too heavy. I'm too weak.	I'm not able to make a connection between the sound of, what might have been, a voice and the origin of it.	Trying with no effect	Every morning when I came out to check on my bunny Rosa she was hanging out with the same pheasant. I imagined them exchanging life experiences. Sharing a deep connection. I never wanted to interrupt but at some point I had to make sure that she had everything she needed. So I would reluctantly cause the pheasant to flee their ceremony. But he was always back the next morning.	How can they care so little for others?	A warm and calm sensation in my chest. Soft light of low saturated orange and pink. The light answers to your happiness with a slow pulsation. The more safe and happy I sense that you are, the more the warm glow spreads to the rest of my body.	The smell of rain on pavement	The best thing about this mall is the cocktail bar. And the only right way to do christmas shopping is in the middle of the day while tipsy. Which is why I am on my third bar break. As the bartender handed me this cocktail he gave me a curious look and said “You're playing a dangerous game.” I really am. A lovely, dangerous game. Lots of christmas gifts for everyone this year.	The way she played the piano was like she was speaking through it. She didn't use it like an instrument. It was an extension of her. I didn't know that was possible. I didn't know I actually liked jazz. I have been missing out. I am going to change that.	Please don't leave right now. I need a hand to hold. My own presence isn't enough. I need you to keep me from scattering.	Don't try to make me feel guilty about it. It is out of my hands. I am affected by it too and it is making me feel even worse when you talk to me like this. I have been doing what I can and I would really appreciate some acknowledgement for that.
Constant buzzing in my head down to my shoulders. One moment I can see all the details of the origin of the buzzing. Next moment the conteurs gets too fuzzy to make out any details at all. My thoughts are restricted to move only in certain lanes. Sometimes I see other smoother lanes but as soon as I try to shift my thoughts to them they appear clogged or they dissolve. There must be some way out but all lanes lead back to the buzzing.	Sucking in air.	He was sitting close enough for me to put my face right in front of his. I hissed “if that's the case then that's not your fucking problem, is it?” I sat back down and turned away from him. With clenched teeth I tried to pretend he wasn't there. Eventually he gave up and left but my jaw didn't relax until much later.	I am standing at the intersection of two different realities. In one I am close to everyone I love but bored. In the other I would be lonely. But there wouldn't be much time to think about that with all the other stuff going on. Would it be disrespectful to the universe if I flip a coin?	I put all of this effort into it and now you want me to stop? Like I don't have better things to do?	Thick black tar in my chest. It seeps out. Slowly poisoning the rest of my body.	I must be in a very good place in my life right now.	The ferry slowly leaves the harbour. I have no idea where to go once we get there. I have no money. No one there to call. Nowhere to stay.	His lips are moving.	Many small steps, each draining	I make my mind relax. The more relaxed it is the stronger it gets.	I've been trying to practice patience. It doesn't come easily to me.	The look on her face when she opened the present… It still makes me warm to think about it.	The smell of the ocean	You know what? Go ahead! Your threats lost their weight as soon as I gained some sense of self worth. You know what about your threats isn't working any longer? They're not scary. The consequences don't scare me. You don't scare me. Just get out.	A flow opens up from the bottom of my gut and runs through my heart up to my brain. The flow is light and effortless but powerful. It makes it easy to breathe. The outer world disappears and the inner one takes over. It unfolds beyond my body.	I wanted to be honest. But every time I tried I could hear my voice tremble. I had to take long pauses. Take deep breaths. But it only helped for the moment. I tried to pretend that everything was fine but I think they all noticed.	The path from my mind and mouth to my solar plexus is open and clear.
Assuming.	It was painful and I felt completely alive.	Look, all I need is to be provided with the forms before the shift starts. I am not enjoying this. They are definitely not enjoying this. There is a very simple solution to all of it. But it is out of my reach. Right now there is chaos that I am not responsible for but that I have to answer for. It shouldn't be like this.	My mind shifts focus from one side of my chest to the other. Each of the sides feels like the absolute truth. It feels like if I look deep enough I'll find the answer. The deeper I get the more shallow it seems	Why don't you ever tidy anything up? Look at this mess. There's stuff everywhere. Can you make yourself useful and put some of it away? Not like that, you're doing it wrong. Everything is wrong.	She gets to hold his hand.	He could have taken his last breath from a hospital bed but we got to bring him home.	It's dark. I can't see or feel anything. It's completely empty. I look for my heart, my lungs, anything. There's nothing. I don't want to say anything. I'm scared the emptiness will steal my voice.	I look out of the window.	Laying on the floor	It's about his energy.	Constantly reminding myself people mess up sometimes.	She deserves to always feel that way.	The touch of a cool breeze	Holograms of former constraints run like strings through my body. From my head to my gut. I move through them freely. They are remnants of a different perspective. A perspective that held me captive. The more I move the more frail they get. It is a liberating act.	I don't actually need a plan!	Don't ask me how I'm doing.	The truth lies firm within my solar plexus. It is a stable warm yellow glow. It sends out a consistent stream of energy. What comes back from outside is reflected before it has a chance to affect my truth.
Assuming bad consequences.	I didn't know why.	Oh my god!	If I text her she could either not get back at all, in which case I'd know.	If we get a cat it's not like there's only going to be cuddles. It'll be weeks of peeing everywhere before it learns where to pee. And sometimes they choose to pee in your shoes just to annoy you. Believe me it'll be more work than cuddles.	It's not right.	How incredibly sweet to be mocked by that voice.	I need to do better next time.	The laughter of playing toddlers hits an invisible barrier, falls down to the ground and never reaches my ears.	I'm laying on the floor.	I am engulfed by his movements.	They're not using their own heads. I don't know if it's because they don't know how to or because they're lazy. Or maybe they're scared. They're relying on others to make the calls while they don't care about the accuracy. Just look into something on your own! Anything! What a waste of minds.	I will never let anything hurt you.	The smell of your loved one	Worst thing that could happen is that I lose my job.	I can just start with what I have now.	I couldn't look back.	All the barriers that have been protecting the truth are gone. Empty space surrounds a drying piece of lava within my solar plexus. As I put the spotlight on it the surface starts cracking. Through the cracks I see warm yellow light.
Assuming others have uncomfortable knowledge about you.	He said he wanted to	She's not even looking our way.	Or she could reply.	What's the use? It's going to be loud. The food is usually not even that good. If I stay home I can at least eat my boring food in silence.	Why am I the only one feeling this way?	I couldn't believe my eyes. I finally understood how people could come up with fantasy places like that planet in Avatar. They actually exist. I kept yelling: are you fucking kidding me? I don't know if I was yelling at myself or god.	They all think I'm lazy but I just don't notice it.	In here, it's empty.	dozing off with coffee in hand	His fingers have transported to the actual time of when it happened.	Some people go through a long process to be approved to adopt. But any idiot can accidentally become a parent without knowing anything about love. No one knows how to parent before having a child. Most people can learn, but others are simply not worthy. Some people should not be allowed to have kids.	I will always keep you safe.	The sound of a stream	I'll get another one.	I don't know but I look forward to seeing where I'll end up!	If I look back, I'll break.	The only thing that is left when I stop analysing is: I love having you around.
Assuming others have bad intentions.	Everything felt sharp and hazy at the same time. I vaguely felt his body press into mine while a crunchy anger radiated outwards.	Hellooooo!	Sounding happy or dismissive.	Look at this mess.	Nowhere in the universe is this right..	Two weeks ago I thought it was over. I thought he wouldn't make it out. That I had lost my last chance for at least six months. But here we are. Shoulder to shoulder. I forget to pay attention so I'd know when I'm supposed to laugh. But I hear every little syllable she says. I experience them as if they didn't have relationships to other syllables. And each one of them brings a unique message to the part of me that still remembers what purpose feels like. How am I supposed to know when she gets to the punchline?	I don't know how to be like them.	Out there, I don't know.	I'm so tired of trying.	They are proving the relativity of everything.	She's fake. They think she wants to help but I see right through her. Did you see how she went to grab the samples just when the creative director walked in? And she got all cred for it. She doesn't fucking care about the samples! I'm telling you, she doesn't. I'm the one who picked them out. I don't care how nice she seems.	I wish he was standing so I could offer him my seat.	My mind is still. What I perceive is what occupies it but without causing ripples. I perceive my emotions and not even them are causing my mind to move. Details are solemn. Time is irrelevant.	The baby is fine, believe me.	When I saw what she had done I was amazed.	I hadn't seen my family in six months.	What else is there to say?
Being unsure of yourself.	The amount I want to be there would take a couple lifetimes but we have hours at most.	Your car! You need to move it!	Or maybe indifferent.	Not like that, you're doing it wrong. Everything is wrong.	I wish I could be happy for him but the truth is I can't.	I couldn't believe my eyes.	I don't know how to care about the right things.	In here, it's safe. There's a scary void. But it's safe	Feeling so utterly ineffective.	I look at where the hurt should be.	I know the kind. He thinks his title means he knows what he's doing. Anyone could do his job.	I hope he's going home to someone who loves and takes care of him.	No analyzing, wondering, having opinions or otherwise thinking.	My whole body knows that everything is fine.	A completely new way of thinking.	While they were waiting for me at the airport, I was stranded at a different airport in a different country.	At the end of the day you need to take responsibility for your own learning.
I know you think he's a nice guy but it got really uncomfortable when we were alone.	I am consumed with everything. I am nearly manic. I check in with friends and each one is a whole world unto themselves.	What ... Where is she going?	If I don't text her I can keep on living in my fantasy world.	If we get a cat it's not like there's only going to be cuddles.	I guess the goal is just an excuse for them to be important.	They actually exist.	I need to do better.	I am vaguely aware of the physical world and my own body. A floating sensation. It's like an escape that brings me relief. At the same time it is a prison.	Eventually he moved out.	Is it stable because of strong denial or because of profound self respect?	I did way better than anyone in my class. I don't know why they were struggling. I finished all assignments in one day. Maybe they should have chosen something that fits them better. Something easier.	I don't understand but I know and trust that you have your reasons. I will still be here. There is literally nowhere else I want to be.	Only experiencing.	It's just a thing that humans made up to get the illusion that their projects are being managed.	I could do that too!	I asked a lady at the info desk if she could please help me call my mom.	Where my capabilities end, your responsponsibilities begin.
I am reaching for all thoughts containing clues.	An enormous amount of energy is moving around my chest. It's looking for actions to take. The energy itself overpowers the initiations for action.	Are you kidding me?!!	I wish I knew what I'm really risking.	It'll be weeks of peeing everywhere before it learns where to pee.	I honestly thought the goal itself was important.	I don't know if I was yelling at myself or god.	It's like mom stopped existing through some kind of evil magic.	The lake is black. It doesn't even reflect the deep blue night sky. There is a sound of water lapping against the small pier. The soft wind brings a distorted sound of chatter from the cabin up on the hill. A yellow warm light coming from the windows makes the hill seem friendlier than this pier. They haven't even noticed that I'm gone. They probably won't. I wonder what it's like to be missed by someone.	too much for me, for us, to handle.	It needs deeper investigation.	They're not using their own heads.	I find her around the corner of the house kicking the bike on the ground. “Stupid, stupid bike!” She is yelling. As soon as she realizes that I'm watching she crosses her arms and looks down in rage and shame. “GO AWAY!” I give her some space but make sure that she can still see me. She starts crying “I'm never going to learn”. I walk over, sit down next to her and place her on my lap. “Of course you will. The thing is, we don't know how to do anything before we've learned how to do it. And until we've learned we fail everytime we do it. And because we can't look into the future and feel what it's like to do something we've never done, it'll feel like it's never going to happen. But then all of a sudden we've done it enough times and it works!” I pause. She has stopped crying. “Do you want to try again? Or should we take a break?” She gives me an annoyed look, stands up and grabs the bike. I guess my speech was more confusing than motivating. She disappears on the bike behind a bush before I have a chance to offer my help. I hear metallic bumps. She starts yelling again. “STUPID BIIIIIKE!” I give her some space but make sure that she can still see me.	Often involves appreciation.	The projects are pretty much illusions too.	I can disregard what I have been taught.	I couldn't stop the tears falling down my cheeks.	That's not how life works.
Trying to put it all together.	I didn't think he'd actually fall! I put out my foot in front of him, next thing I knew all I could see was the sole of his feet sticking out of the next room. A textbook faceplant. I was laughing so hard I ended up lying down on the floor next to him.	Hey!! HEY!!!	I mean that changes everything.	And sometimes they choose to pee in your shoes just to annoy you.	I can't really put my finger on it.	But here we are.	The door was the last thing that got to experience her alive.	The laughter of playing toddlers hits an invisible barrier six feet away from me. It falls down to the ground and never reaches my ears. In here, it's empty. Out there, I don't know. In here, it's safe. There's a scary void. But it's safe.	it's just constant pushback	I take a deep breath.	I don't know if it's because they don't know how to or because they're lazy.	I don't understand but I know and trust that you have your reasons. I will still be here.	I hear a woodpecker.	Anyway, they're pointless out here.	I can do it my way.	Please don't leave right now.	The truth is I am scared.
My gut has been telling me “he is not to be trusted” while my brain has been saying “you need to be more understanding”.	What do you mean I have it? My hands are empty! You must have taken it! Or it disappeared. I don't see it. Wait a second … what's that behind your ear? Omg, it's the troll! Lol! How did you do that?	Oh hell no, she is not getting away.	I think.	Believe me it'll be more work than cuddles.	Every time someone brings up her name I feel sick and angry.	Shoulder to shoulder.	“It'll be okay, I promise. Mommy misses you too and she's coming back soon.”	“What's the matter? Didn't you say you wanted to go? And now you're acting all weird.” I'm staring at the floor. He knows exactly what happened. I tried to explain as usual. He turned it into my own fault, as usual. Words are pointless. Making an effort is pointless. I'm staring at the floor but I'm floating above the roof.	Again, again	I let my shoulders relax to a lower position.	They're relying on others to make the calls while they don't care about the accuracy.	There is literally nowhere else I want to be.	The bark is cold and rough against my ear.	The best thing about this mall is the cocktail bar.	I didn't know that was possible.	I need a hand to hold.	I told him exactly what happened. I went to disneyland.
If his behaviour is this irrational I obviously cannot trust him.	Let's do this. So the plan is: sprint ‘til we die. Is that it? Lol, I guess that's all we need!	I slam the car door behind me as I almost run towards her with heavy determined feet.	Have you told your mom?	What's the use?	It's not intimidation.	I forget to pay attention so I'd know when I'm supposed to laugh.	This is the kind of crying that comes from a deep, inconsolable place of loss.	“Are you okay?” I look up. I'm not able to make a connection between the sound of, what might have been, a voice and the origin of it. An old, bearded man. His lips are moving. It makes the long, gray beard move too. I look out of the window. The sound of the train gets louder.	I am exhausted	My breathing shifts from my lungs to my stomach.	Just look into something on your own!	I give her some space but make sure that she can still see me.	I can feel every peck on my skin.	The only right way to do christmas shopping is in the middle of the day while tipsy.	I am going to change that.	My own presence isn't enough.	I am spending more time at school than I have to because I don't want to come home to this any longer.
What else has he stolen?	All the movement in my head has slowly moved down to my gut. It's creating sparks. Spreading to all my limbs. Making them move with purpose.	He was sitting close enough for me to put my face right in front of his.	Are you really sure you're going?	It's going to be loud.	It's more a sense of … not being recognized.	And each one of them brings a unique message to the part of me that still remembers what purpose feels like.	It doesn't matter what I do.	The easy togetherness is gone, each of us lost to our individual confusion.	The blur of faces	Success.	Anything!	God, sometimes I want to squeeze her so hard I'm scared it would hurt her. I can't help it.	I don't say anything.	Which is why I am on my third bar break.	That's the kind of person I want to be.	I need you to keep me from scattering.	We need a change.
I reevaluate our whole relationship.	I didn't think he'd actually fall!	I hissed “if that's the case then that's not your fucking problem, is it?”	I am not coming with you.	The food is usually not even that good.	Sure, she's skilled at what she's doing but just because she was on TV doesn't mean she's the best.	Of course I don't regret anything. How could I possibly regret any of it giving the result? I don't think that anyone should ever have to go through something like that. It shouldn't be necessary to be able to get to this point. But to lose all of this in order to get rid of those traumas? It's like that kind of thinking doesn't work once you're on the other side of it.	I am not the right person.	“My assistant can schedule a time for us to talk,” he wrote. I'm furious. Insulted. Hurt. Then just sad. He was the best man at my wedding. How can he act like I'm a project to be managed? I'm stinging, wanting to hit him back. Make him feel as bad as I do. But, you can't make someone want to be your friend. You can't guilt them into it. Nothing to do but forget.	Can't fall asleep, can't wake up	My body follows my mind and my mind follows my body.	What a waste of minds.	The way he sneezes. It's like his soul tickles me.	I don't feel like I should say anything	A lovely, dangerous game.	I still find more of my inner strength whenever I think of him.	Every time I tried I could hear my voice tremble.	We need a serious change.
Each action that I previously saw at the border of distrust and understanding is now clearly on the distrust side.	I put out my foot in front of him, next thing I knew all I could see was the sole of his feet sticking out of the next room.	I sat back down and turned away from him.	Too much drama.	If I stay home I can at least eat my boring food in silence.	They have no idea what I have accomplished.	Of course I don't regret anything.	Eventually I start crying too.	He said he didn't believe in monogamous relationships anymore. I knew he had met someone else. The hurt of him wanting another person didn't come close to the hurt of him continuing to tell me he loved me. As long as he kept saying that I couldn't leave. But he was long gone.	Dozing off with coffee in hand	Why do we even call it by two different names?	But any idiot can accidentally become a parent without knowing anything about love.	Whenever he's away I don't clean the house. I like finding his hair everywhere. It's like the space contains his presence still.	We just sit there.	Lots of christmas gifts for everyone this year.	There was nothing we were afraid of.	I had to take long pauses.	I am affected by it too and it is making me feel even worse when you talk to me like this.
He has been lying about everything this whole time.	I was laughing so hard I ended up lying down on the floor next to him.	With clenched teeth I tried to pretend he wasn't there.	Are we bringing dates?	I keep going to bed thinking maybe tomorrow will be better.	How could they?	How could I possibly regret any of it giving the result?	This is not how it should be handled but I am not capable.	“My assistant can schedule a time for us to talk,” he wrote. I'm furious. Insulted. Hurt. Then just sad.	I stole a car. It started as a joke with my friend, then it was a dare.	Every morning when I came out to check on my bunny Rosa she was hanging out with the same pheasant.	Most people can learn, but others are simply not worthy.	It's been six hours. There's no wifi on the flight. I wonder if she's already there. I know she doesn't like public displays of affection. Will she get upset if I can't contain myself? This flight is taking forever!	There is nothing but love in his eyes.	You know what? Go ahead!	It was a constant contest to prove we each had more in us than the other.	It only helped for the moment.	“You're such a dreamer.” He laughed. I knew that was the moment it was over. I didn't know that I could move the world but I knew I if I did it would be because I believed I could.
Why in the world would my mind make up something like that?	My hands are empty!	Eventually he gave up and left but my jaw didn't relax until much later.	Gaahh, why are you doing this to me?	I wake up counting the hours until I can go back to sleep.	I wish I had the time and money.	But to lose all of this in order to get rid of those traumas?	While I have no choice but to wait, my classmates finish their meals and leave for the bus.	How can he act like I'm a project to be managed?	He was confused and I just acted like it was normal and he went along with it.	I imagined them exchanging life experiences.	Some people should not be allowed to have kids.	The simple act of holding your hand feels like the most profound connection, a silent promise that we're in this together.	I sense each punch as soon as she starts throwing them.	The consequences don't scare me.	The world is ours. We can't die. What could go wrong?	I tried to pretend that everything was fine but I think they all noticed.	All I've ever wanted is more. In every direction, as much as I can, at all times, to the further extent possible. I want what is hard. That feeling of pressing on not knowing if it's attainable. Only knowing that I have to keep trying.
Am I the one needing reevaluation?	Wait a second … what's that behind your ear?	I am not enjoying this. They are definitely not enjoying this.	I really thought the cool breeze of the ocean would help clear my mind.	I stare at my phone until I can't anymore.	I wish I was one of them.	I'm filled with a strong but pleasant white light. It knocks out all my outer senses while my inner senses are having orgasms.	I'm not worth waiting for.	I'm stinging, wanting to hit him back.	Can you play some music? I asked to distract him.	Sharing a deep connection.	She's fake.	In the quiet moments, as our fingers entwine, I feel a universe of love expanding between us, transcending words and finding solace in the shared silence.	Listening to a woodpecker's rhythmic pecks, feeling the vibrations in trees.	You don't scare me.	I just open my mouth and let it come out. I'm witnessing along with everyone else.	We're on a long walk again. But it's not the same. That feeling of possibility around each turn is gone. I think of the moment when I broke it, his face falling as the film scene we'd been dreamily inhabiting faded into reality. We're still here, maybe even more grounded in a love for each other. But the love can never again be the giddy, electric, surprising kind.	I'm on the last 1600 and I feel my brain starting to resist. It fills me with doubt. What's the point? But I trained for this exact confrontation. I'm ready for it. This is the moment to override the voice. I can keep going. There is no stopping. I want this. I kick out a 200 meter sprint. I feel my thoughts retreat, along with my opponents. I've beaten them. Pounding on in a high of pain and ecstasy to the finish.
If anyone asks me what I think about it they'll immediately realize that I have no idea what I'm talking about.	Omg, it's the troll!	There is a very simple solution to all of it. But it is out of my reach.	Leave only the important parts.	A run that turns into a walk.	I wish I had deadlines to complain about.	Waking up to a kitchen floor covered in spilled coffee grounds, I couldn't help but burst into laughter. The mess didn't bother me at all; it was like a surprise hit in the face without the pain, a sign that I must be in a very good place in my life right now.	I don't finish my food.	I want to make him feel as bad as I do.	I will do anything you want.	So I would reluctantly cause the pheasant to flee their ceremony.	They think she wants to help but I see right through her.	Your laughter echoes through the room, a melody that transforms ordinary days into extraordinary memories, painting our world with hues of joy.	A silent moment with her, hand in hand, feeling comfortably close.	Oops! Oh, well.	They lose control over their faces as they watch stunned.	That smell of cold leaves always takes me back to Boston. I feel the wind crawling up my skirt. I feel so grounded, so sure of myself here. And the itching to throw that feeling away. You can be so close to someone one day and gone the next. Could I stay in place if I were less reckless, more content? Or is everything always slipping away?	I know some people need deadlines, but for me, they've never been more than an administrative detail. My expectations for myself far outpace any requirement others can set. There's nothing better than the feeling of making a todo list. My mind is focused. Each task laid out in front of me, it's just a matter of returning again and again. Someone once told me that procrastination was really an emotional management problem. So I developed tricks for shifting my emotions when I see myself put off one an item on my list.
They'll start wondering why I was even allowed to be here in the first place.	Lol!	Right now there is chaos that I am not responsible for but that I have to answer for.	It didn't.	I take a shower that turns into laying in my towel on my bed for two hours.	But some people live in huge houses with loving families.	Fulfilling his last wish, we brought him home to pass away in the house he built for his family fifty years earlier. His final breath was taken while gazing over the same fields he cherished as a toddling little boy, and the warmth of that moment lingers in our hearts.	I don't go on the field trip.	But you can't make someone want to be your friend.	Custom order, delivered apathy—no desires, no demands, just indifference.	But he was always back the next morning.	I'm telling you, she doesn't.	Watching you pursue your dreams, I see a constellation of determination in your eyes, and my heart swells with pride, knowing you're bound for greatness.	My neck aches, but acceptance reigns as he holds my cheek.	Lol!	I feel a flash of power. I do it again. What will they do?	We are seven, putting on a puppet show, when suddenly I notice our playing doesn't make sense anymore. What happened to the stories we used to make believe? When did it get so hard? It used to just flow. Now there are all these questions and negotiations. I'm looking around me but now everything is looking back. The easy togetherness is gone, each of us lost to our individual confusion.	“You're such a dreamer.” He laughed. I knew that was the moment it was over.
During the introductions she gave me a look that said “How predictable. Not capable of forming thoughts with any kind of substance.”	How did you do that?	It shouldn't be like this!	Sigh.	I log on, I blink into existence, I blink out. Nothing matters. Nobody exists.	Some of us are stuck in small apartments.	After three days of worrying about his safety in an area prone to bombings, a call finally came from an unknown number. Hearing his cheery voice almost felt like sweet mockery, a reminder of the relief that can only be felt when the worst fears are proven wrong.	It feels like I'm not sure I exist.	Nothing to do but forget.	Tired of complexities, uninterested in relationships, exhausted by life's demands.	In a small village, a group gathers to listen to the man who claims to have glimpsed a parallel universe. The air is charged with curiosity as they hang on to his every word.	I don't care how nice she seems.	Every touch, every shared gaze, is a testament to the unwavering bond that holds us close, an unspoken language that only love can articulate.	Sensing each punch, a dance in the ring, feeling every move.	If they do I'll handle it when it happens.	Nobody seems to be able to stop me. Least of all me.	We're on a long walk again. But it's not the same.	I didn't know that I could move the world but I knew I if I did it would be because I believed I could.
Why did they accept me if I don't belong here?	Let's do this.	I hissed “if that's the case then that's not your fucking problem, is it?” 	What do I do?	I didn't know the daylight could feel so dark. Dark is too passionate of a word. It's just gray in every direction.	With passive aggressive roommates and their leaching partners.	The knots that once clenched my chest have vanished, and the absence of their presence makes every breath easy. The even illumination banishes shadows, and the negative hovers like transparent shadows, accentuating the clarity of the positive.	We're slowly sinking.	He said he didn't believe in monogamous relationships anymore. I knew he had met someone else.	Rejecting parenthood, avoiding complications, embracing the simplicity of indifference.	Amidst the clutter of mundane conversations, his storytelling captivates the room, weaving a tapestry of curiosity that draws others into the rich fabric of his experiences.	I know the kind.	Life's uncertainties fade away when your arms envelop me, creating a haven where the storms outside are powerless against the warmth we cocoon ourselves in.	Engulfed in nature's openness: bonfires, winds, rain, ocean, breezes.	What if this and what if that.	Embracing youth, fearless and bold, a world where we owned everything.	That feeling of possibility around each turn is gone.	All I've ever wanted is more.
Maybe they always do that to one person. As a game.	So the plan is: sprint ‘til we die.	I am not enjoying this. They are definitely not enjoying this. Hellooooo! I sat back down and turned away from him.	Maybe I'll join them for a little bit.	I keep living because I don't want to hurt the people around me. I'm already contributing nothing, no point making it worse.	Goddamnit I could kill the next person posting a picture of their beautiful backyard.	Noticing the absence of negative consequences where they could have been, and recognizing the presence of positive outcomes where they weren't expected, amplifies the gratitude for the current state of joy.	He's too heavy.	The hurt of him wanting another person didn't come close to the hurt of him continuing to tell me he loved me.	Overwhelmed by responsibilities, tired of explaining, indifferent to their understanding.	She discovered an old journal in the attic, unlocking the secrets of a bygone era. With each turned page, her interest intensified, unraveling the forgotten tales that had long been concealed.	He thinks his title means he knows what he's doing.	The way you effortlessly radiate kindness, offering a comforting presence to those around you, makes my heart swell with admiration and love.	The touch of a cool breeze, the scent of a loved one.	What if nothing?	Words flow freely, faces astonished, a newfound sense of unstoppable expression.	I think of the moment when I broke it, his face falling as the film scene we'd been dreamily inhabiting faded into reality.	In every direction, as much as I can, at all times, to the further extent possible. I want what is hard.
All of a sudden he starts crossing the street. He is aiming for me.	Lol, I guess that's all we need!	Eventually he gave up and left but my jaw didn't relax until much later. It shouldn't be like this! Oh my god!	Or I could tell them I'm not feeling well.	I'm not gonna do it. It just feels good to google. At least it feels like something.	All I ever wanted was a my little pony.	In a moment of disbelief, I encountered a place so fantastical it could rival the landscapes of fictional planets. The sheer wonder of the sight had me yelling, "Are you kidding me?" unsure if I was addressing myself or some divine presence.	I'm too weak.	As long as he kept saying that I couldn't leave. But he was long gone.	The chaotic routine, the draining steps, result in a nonchalant collapse.	His lecture on quantum physics sparks an intellectual fire, igniting the minds of the audience as they lean forward, eager to grasp the complexities of a universe governed by unseen forces.	Anyone could do his job.	As we navigate the complexities of life hand in hand, your unwavering support becomes the compass guiding us through the labyrinth of challenges.	Mind still, no ripples—only experiencing, open to the present.	What if the apocalypse gets here before the end of the day?	Learning from randomness, no need for a rigid plan. Unleash possibilities.	We're still here, but the love can never again be the giddy, electric, surprising kind.	That feeling of pressing on not knowing if it's attainable. Only knowing that I have to keep trying.
He is going to push me down the slope.	I am consumed with everything.	Stop it. You cannot leave every time something makes you feel uncomfortable. You think you are protecting the both of us but you are making the gap between us bigger and bigger. The more you run away the further we get from being able to fix it. You need to stop right now. Or I will start hating you and everything will be lost forever.	I am standing at the intersection of two different realities.	I try to remember what enjoying things felt like but it's just a desolate blank.	At this time I didn't know it was possible to dislike someone just because they had something I didn't.	Two weeks ago, it felt like everything was over, and I had lost my last chance for at least six months. Yet, here we are, shoulder to shoulder, and every syllable she utters is a unique message that reconnects me with the purpose I had nearly forgotten.	I have no idea where to go once we get there.	The gentle breeze carries muffled laughter from the distant cabin on the hill. Unbeknownst to them, I've slipped away, and the emptiness wraps around me like a shroud.	Faces blur, languages blend—indifferent to the exhausting whirlwind of existence.	As the documentary unfolds, revealing the enigmatic life of a reclusive artist, viewers find themselves immersed in a world of creativity and mystery, their interest piqued by the artist's unconventional journey.	I did way better than anyone in my class.	Your smile is a beacon, a lighthouse in the darkest moments, reassuring me that no matter what, our shared journey is filled with happiness.	Standing under the night sky, absorbing the vastness of stars.	It makes sense when I see it from his perspective. He is protecting himself and it has nothing to do with me. It feels good to know that I couldn't have changed anything. I wish I could help, but it is okay that I can't.	Dad's joy for neighbors, even excluded, genuine happiness for their success.	That smell of cold leaves always takes me back to Boston. I feel the wind crawling up my skirt.	But I trained for this exact confrontation. I'm ready for it.
In shelter of the bushes he is going to rape me.	I am nearly manic.	I don't care about your opinions. We are getting nowhere. You think you have chosen the right side but every side is the wrong side. There are no winners. Your actions are disconnected from your true beliefs. I don't know how to fix anything or if it's even possible. But don't you dare bring up your opinions again. They bring nothing but the unveiling of your ego.	Would it be disrespectful to the universe if I flip a coin?	I'll do whatever you tell me to. If I can find the energy.	I didn't feel happy for her either.	Staring in disbelief, the existence of such places seemed surreal, like discovering that the fantasy planets depicted in movies actually exist. The exclamation, "Are you fucking kidding me?" echoed in disbelief, questioning the reality before my eyes.	I have no money.	They continue their animated conversation, oblivious to my absence. I find myself staring at the floor, where words seem futile, and making an effort feels utterly pointless.	Sleepless nights, coffee-fueled daze—indifferent to the chaotic rhythm of life.	A chance encounter with a stranger sparks an exchange of stories and perspectives. The conversation becomes a dance of shared curiosity, each question unveiling layers of hidden narratives.	I don't know why they were struggling.	In the quiet solitude of the evening, I find solace in the gentle rhythm of your heartbeat, a symphony that serenades our shared existence.	Gazing into the horizon, feeling the world's endless possibilities.	Today I finished three out of five tasks on my list. The list was too long. It would have been enough with two. Three made me too tired to enjoy the day. But it did make me feel more accomplished than two would have. Perhaps there is a sweet spot between expectations and capabilities. Or perhaps finding that sweet spot is an impossible task. I did my best. If it feels like it wasn't enough, it is my own making.	Unaware of rules, she defied norms, a revelation to live differently.	I feel so grounded, so sure of myself here. And the itching to throw that feeling away.	This is the moment to override the voice. I can keep going. There is no stopping. I want this.
I know exactly what is about to happen to me.	The mountain air was crisp as I stood on the summit, the world below unfolding in a breathtaking panorama. I inhaled deeply, feeling the chill penetrate my lungs, and for a moment, the entire universe seemed to pulsate with life.	They took all of our money. I really thought they were helping. But they took all of our money. I don't know what's worse, realizing that I am this naive or that there actually are people capable of that kind of deceit. The worst part is that I have no outlet. They are long gone and if I blame myself I will make things worse. I feel a deep need to break something.	Rediscovering an old photo on my computer, a relic of a vulnerable moment, leaves me in a state of confusion, wondering if the doubts and fears captured are an accurate reflection of who I am or merely ghosts of the past.	Staring at the computer screen, I pour my energy into tasks, hoping for a spark of motivation. Yet, it feels like everything dissolves into a void, leaving me drained and disheartened.	I just felt a lack.	The realization that he made it out, defying the belief that I had lost my last chance, fills me with joy. In the company of laughter, I forget to pay attention to the punchline, relishing every syllable as if each one carried a unique message to rekindle the sense of purpose.	No one there to call.	My gaze remains fixed on the floor, aching to connect with something meaningful. I'm suspended above the roof, unable to bridge the gap between the distorted voice and its source.	Lay on the floor, indifference seeping through the exhaustion of futile efforts.	The antique shop holds treasures of forgotten stories, and as she explores its shelves, her interest grows with each relic, each item whispering tales of a time long past.	Maybe they should have chosen something that fits them better. Something easier.	In the tapestry of our shared experiences, every thread of laughter and shared glances weaves a story of love that time cannot unravel.	Holding an old book, its pages open to adventures untold.	When everything is constantly changing, how can we take so much for granted? I guess it would take a lot of energy to be open for everything at every moment. That must be why babies need so much sleep.	Handless wrestler's strength, a perspective shift, my problems now seem small.	You can be so close to someone one day and gone the next.	I kick out a 200 meter sprint. I feel my thoughts retreat, along with my opponents. I've beaten them. Pounding through a high of pain and ecstasy to the finish.
My legs are the only things not paralyzed.	The sudden downpour caught us off guard, but instead of seeking shelter, we danced in the rain, every raindrop a reminder of the electrifying sensation that comes with embracing the unexpected.	Why do I keep doing this to myself? The same pattern. Over and over again. Where did my lack of self respect come from? If I could find the source, I would grab it by its throat and tell it to never come back.	Wrestling with the purpose of my existence, I question whether I'm merely a distraction, an intruder in places where I don't belong. The anxiety builds, and I struggle to reconcile my role in a world that seems to offer little.	The sensation of slow decay lingers, a persistent feeling of dying inside over months. A friend's concern triggers dark thoughts, tempting me to explore the unthinkable, finding a strange solace in the bleakness of internet searches.	A proof that I could be happier if things were different.	The rain caught us off guard during the hike, soaking us through. Instead of frustration, we erupted into laughter, dancing in the downpour, finding unexpected joy in the midst of nature's surprise.	Nowhere to stay.	His lips move, forming words that float in the air. I turn my attention to the window, shutting out the laughter of playing toddlers, their joy unable to breach the invisible barrier that guards my heart.	Many small steps, each draining, culminating in a nonchalant surrender.	At the science fair, a young inventor showcases a device that defies conventional wisdom. Spectators lean in with curiosity, eager to understand the mechanism behind the invention.	He calls me into the office. I'm out of dress code again, it's a detention. But so is everyone I argue. Another detention for talking back. That's not fair! Another, do I want to keep going? Suddenly I'm back in time out yelling at my mom. She screams back. My breathing is fast. I'm angry but focused. What to shout to frustrate her the most. Each attempt adds to my punishment, have to make it worth it. She keeps getting louder, I'm getting to her, but if I don't stop now, I'll be in here for a month.	Your presence is a melody, playing softly in the background of my life, turning mundane moments into harmonies of joy and warmth.	Walking through an open field, wind whispering through the grass.	I should have told her exactly what I felt. It is too late now and it hurts. I think it is because I lost an opportunity to get closure. I will have to find it myself. I will remember this sensation. I will speak next time it arises. Nothing is lost. All can be gained.	Piano speaks, an extension of her, discovering the language of jazz.	Could I stay in place if I were less reckless, more content? Or is everything always slipping away?	I know some people need deadlines, but for me, they've never been more than an administrative detail.
Trying to put it all together. Maybe they always do that to one person. As a game. I reevaluate our whole relationship. I am reaching for all thoughts containing clues. In shelter of the bushes he is going to rape me.	As the roller coaster plummeted, the wind roared in my ears, and the adrenaline surged through my veins, creating a symphony of exhilaration that drowned out all other thoughts.	Look at me. I don't ever want to see that kind of behaviour again. Is that clear? If you have a problem with someone in this group you tell me right away and we will deal with it. When you choose to act this disrespectful you are breaking the rules that we all promised to follow. It is unacceptable. The same goes for all of us. Do we agree?	A haunting photo serves as a warning, a constant reminder of my unchanging nature. Despite the desire to delete it, the image persists, casting doubt on my ability to evolve and learn from past mistakes.	Despite investing tremendous effort, the request to stop feels like a dismissal of purpose. The weight of expectations intensifies, leaving me questioning the significance of my endeavors.	Watching them share laughter, she holds his hand, and I'm left with the bitter taste of envy, wondering why I'm the sole bearer of this unjust emotion in the vast expanse of the universe.	Opening the old photo album, memories flooded back. Each snapshot held a piece of shared laughter, and the warmth of those moments enveloped me, making me smile with gratitude for the beautiful journey.	It's dark.	Inside, it's an echoing emptiness, a sanctuary from the unknown outside. The void is daunting, but within these walls, it feels strangely safe.	Custom order: apathy delivered, a service void of desires or demands.	The old man in the park spins yarns of adventures from his youth. The children sit in a circle, wide-eyed and captivated, their interest fueled by the allure of his timeless tales.	I've always had a problem with authority. I can follow the rules if I understand the point. But if that's not clear or I sense the system isn't enforced equally, I lose it.	When you speak, the timbre of your voice resonates with an affectionate melody, creating a symphony of comfort that soothes my soul.	Sitting on a mountain peak, openness stretching beyond sight.	It is like my heart is leading an analysis by letting my brain naturally unfold. Not seeking new information. Just letting the pieces that are already there find their fitting pieces through the light influence of gravity that is already there. Some pieces are left by themselves. That is okay. I see every piece and every piece is right where it is supposed to be.	Flow from within, gut to brain, effortless power, inner unfolding.	We are seven, putting on a puppet show, when suddenly I notice our playing doesn't make sense anymore. What happened to the stories we used to make believe?	My expectations for myself far outpace any requirement others can set.
Why did they accept me if I don't belong here? If his behaviour is this irrational I obviously cannot trust him. Why in the world would my mind make up something like that? He has been lying about everything this whole time.	In the crowded concert hall, the music reverberated through every fiber of my being, each note a visceral pulse that connected me to the rhythm of a thousand beating hearts.	Stop it.	Contemplating whether to text her opens a Pandora's box of potential reactions. The uncertainty of her response leaves me paralyzed, caught between the desire to know and the fear of the possible outcomes.	Confronted with a messy environment, the simple task of tidying up becomes an overwhelming demand. The inability to meet expectations fuels a sense of uselessness and frustration.	While he revels in the company of the right people, my thoughts drift towards the bigger picture and the elusive final goal. The goal, once significant, now seems like a mere pretext for their undeserved importance.	A random act of kindness from a stranger—a simple smile on a crowded subway—reminded me of the unexpected beauty in humanity, leaving me with a heart brimming with happiness.	It's completely empty.	The echoes of distant laughter mock my solitude. I cling to the safety of this empty room, where the pain of unacknowledged absence lingers.	Tired of complexities, relationships, and life's demands—indifferent to all.	In a dimly lit library, a group gathers for a reading of ancient scrolls. The faded ink holds the secrets of civilizations past, and the room is filled with an air of intellectual curiosity.	That's not fair! Do I want to keep pushing it?	Our shared dreams intertwine like vines, creating a tapestry of aspirations that only grows richer as we navigate the journey together.	Dipping toes into a cool river, embracing the water's openness.	It makes sense when I see it from his perspective.	Radiant sunrise, a canvas of colors, promising a day of possibilities.	When did it get so hard? It used to just flow.	There's nothing better than the feeling of making a todo list.
They'll start wondering why I was even allowed to be here in the first place. My legs are the only things not paralyzed.	The first bite of a fiery chili pepper sent a shockwave through my senses, the burn on my tongue and the tears streaming down my face a testament to the intensity of being truly alive.	You need to stop right now.	Learning about an unexpected purchase alters my reality, and a cascade of questions about dresses, expenses, and dates swirls in my mind, creating a chaotic blend of confusion and reluctance to be involved.	Contemplating getting a cat, the prospect of weeks of mess and inconvenience overshadows the potential for cuddles. The idea of additional responsibilities becomes a heavy burden on already weary shoulders.	Whenever her name is mentioned, a sickening anger churns within me—not intimidation, but the frustration of not being recognized. Skill doesn't equate to being the best; the spotlight often blinds them to true accomplishments.	The unexpected reunion with an old friend brought tears of joy. After years of silence, our laughter echoed in the familiar places, reigniting a bond that time couldn't erase.	I look for my heart, my lungs, anything.	Their voices blur into a cacophony, a dissonant symphony of obliviousness. I retreat into my own silence, staring at the floor, aching from the unspoken hurt.	Rejecting parenthood, avoiding complications, embracing the simplicity of indifference.	The detective pores over the case file, his interest intensifying with each clue. The mystery unravels before him, and he becomes consumed by the pursuit of answers, driven by an insatiable curiosity.	Yelling at my mom. She screams back.	Your quirks and idiosyncrasies are the brushstrokes on the canvas of our relationship, painting a portrait of love that's uniquely ours.	Embracing vulnerability, letting emotions flow without constraint.	He is protecting himself and it has nothing to do with me.	Shared laughter, echoes of joy, connecting hearts in unspoken delight.	I'm looking around me but now everything is looking back.	My mind is focused. Each task laid out in front of me.
I know exactly what is about to happen to me. Am I the one needing reevaluation? What else has he stolen?	On a moonlit beach, we ran into the ocean, the cool waves crashing around us. Each step in the sand and every splash of seawater against my skin heightened the awareness of the raw vitality of the moment.	I will start hating you.	Seeking solace by the ocean, I hoped for clarity and peace of mind. Instead, the heavy dust of confusion remains, refusing to be swept away by the cool breeze, leaving me to grapple with indecision.	Anticipating a social gathering, the thought of noise and mediocre food amplifies the sense of futility. The solitude of home, with its boring food in silence, feels like a preferable alternative to the draining social scene.	Waiting for the bus, my gaze falls upon the fancy outdoor seating where happy visitors gather. I yearn for the time and money to join them, envying their complaints about simple matters like deadlines or babysitters.	As the first notes of the favorite song filled the air, spontaneous dancing ensued. In that moment, surrounded by laughter and music, the world felt like a stage for joyous celebration.	There's nothing.	The laughter of carefree children reverberates, hitting an invisible wall before it can reach me. In the emptiness of my solitude, their joy is a distant, unreachable melody.	Overwhelmed by responsibilities, indifferent to explanations, exhausted by their demands.	The traveler recounts tales of distant lands and exotic cultures. The listeners hang on every word, their interest kindled by the vivid descriptions of a world beyond their own.	My breathing is fast. I'm angry but focused. What to shout to frustrate her the most?	As we dance through the seasons of life, each step is a celebration, and the music of our love echoes through the corridors of time.	Watching a sunrise, feeling the warmth of a new beginning.	It feels good to know that I couldn't have changed anything.	Unexpected kindness, a ripple effect, spreading warmth through simple gestures.	The easy togetherness is gone, each of us lost to our individual confusion.	Someone once told me that procrastination was really an emotional management problem. So I developed tricks for shifting my emotions when I see myself put off one an item on my list.
Google knew my baby's name before I did.	The deafening silence of a starlit night in the wilderness was broken only by the crackling of a campfire. Sitting under the vast expanse of the sky, I felt the heartbeat of the universe, and it resonated within me.	I don't care about your opinions.	Comfort and boredom collide as I debate whether to join others or feign illness to avoid seeming lazy. The internal conflict reflects a struggle between desire for connection and the inertia of contentment.	Inner sensations crumble under the oppressive forces of the outside world, the gray and gravel-like pressure leaving me overwhelmed and suffocated.	We're all affected, but some revel in spacious homes with loving families, while I'm confined to a small apartment with passive-aggressive roommates and their leaching partners. The envy surges each time a picture of a beautiful backyard appears.	Waking up to the sound of rain on the roof, I realized the cozy embrace of a rainy day, relishing the simple pleasure of being wrapped in blankets, sipping hot tea, and finding happiness in the rhythmic patter.	I don't want to say anything.	I watch as they carry on, exchanging words that elude my understanding. The floor becomes a canvas for my silent hurt, a space where pain is written but never spoken.	Chaos in routine, draining steps, culminating in a nonchalant collapse.	As the telescope points toward the night sky, a group of stargazers gathers, their interest soaring with each celestial discovery. The cosmos unfolds before their eyes, a vast canvas of wonder.	Each attempt adds to my punishment, have to make it worth it.	Your touch is a balm, healing wounds unseen, and with each embrace, I find sanctuary in the refuge of your comforting arms.	Observing a butterfly, wings open, revealing intricate patterns.	I wish I could help, but it is okay that I can't.	Echoes of genuine applause, celebrating achievements, a symphony of encouragement.	I've never felt such intense shame, instantly disappointing my family in a way that shattered our special connection.	Amid uncertainty, I find solace in simplicity. I don't need grand gestures; your mere presence is my anchor. The absence of expectations reveals a quiet power that connects us.
All of a sudden he starts crossing the street. He is aiming for me. If we both keep our speed we will reach the same spot at the same time. To my right there is a grass slope leading to bushes in front of the canal. 	The first breath of cold winter air hit me as I stepped outside, and the frosty landscape sparkled in the early morning light. I exhaled, my breath visible, and marveled at the sheer beauty of the frozen world.	We are getting nowhere.	Standing at the intersection of two contrasting realities, I grapple with the choice between closeness and potential loneliness, torn between the comfort of familiarity and the allure of the unknown.	The plea to stop after putting in considerable effort intensifies the feeling of being unappreciated. The constant correction and dissatisfaction with my actions deepen the sense of inadequacy.	Childhood desires resurface as I remember wanting a My Little Pony. At that time, I didn't know that disliking someone solely for possessing what I lacked was possible. Happiness eludes me, replaced by a constant sense of lack.	The shared laughter of a family gathering echoed through the rooms, creating a symphony of love and connection. In those moments, the bonds of kinship became the melody of pure happiness.	I'm scared the emptiness will steal my voice.	As I look out the window, the world beyond is a puzzle of uncertainties. Yet, within these walls, I find solace in the known emptiness, shielded from the potential hurt lurking outside.	Faces blur, languages blend—indifferent to the exhausting whirlwind of existence.	The art exhibition unveils unconventional masterpieces, each stroke of the brush sparking intrigue. Visitors meander through the gallery, their interest ignited by the boundless creativity on display.	She keeps getting louder, I'm getting to her.	In the delicate moments when silence speaks louder than words, our souls commune, exchanging vows of love written in the language of the heart.	Reaching out to a friend, sharing thoughts with open hearts.	Perhaps there is a sweet spot between expectations and capabilities.	A child's laughter, pure and infectious, echoing through the carefree afternoon.	I yearn to rewind time, to erase that moment and rediscover who I was before I shattered expectations.	Life unfolds without a script, and I revel in the spontaneity of our connection. No need for predefined roles; the beauty lies in embracing the unpredictable dance we share.
He is going to push me down the slope. In shelter of the bushes he is going to hurt me. I do not know why I keep walking. I know exactly what is about to happen to me. My legs are the only things not paralyzed. He reaches my side just next to me. I brace myself for the coming push. He passes me and keeps walking.	In the midst of a crowded dance floor, our bodies moved in synchrony to the pulsating beat of the music. The shared energy with strangers created a collective heartbeat that made the entire room feel alive.	There are no winners.	In a moment of introspection, my mind fluctuates between conflicting truths, each side of my chest presenting a different perspective. The quest for answers becomes a journey into the paradox of perceived depth and shallowness.	Criticism about untidiness escalates into a broader feeling of doing everything wrong. Every attempt to rectify the situation seems futile, contributing to a growing sense of incompetence.	A piece of my chest feels missing, found in someone else's possession. Despite my attempts to reclaim it, their belief that it belongs to them leaves me grappling with the unattainable.	Receiving an unexpected letter from a long-lost pen pal brought waves of nostalgia. As I read the heartfelt words, I couldn't help but smile, appreciating the enduring connection forged through ink and paper.	As the medical report unfolded, revealing a diagnosis that felt like a death sentence, the room closed in, and the weight of uncertainty pressed down, leaving me with a profound sense of helplessness.	The distant chatter from the cabin up the hill mingles with the silence in the room, highlighting the absence that weighs heavily on my soul.	Sleepless nights, coffee-fueled daze—indifferent to the chaotic rhythm of life.	A professor introduces a groundbreaking theory to the class, and the students lean forward with rapt attention, their interest in the subject matter blossoming into a thirst for knowledge.	I've always had a problem with authority.	The constellation of memories we've created is a celestial map, guiding us through the vast expanse of life's adventures hand in hand.	Standing at a crossroads, open to the myriad paths ahead.	Perhaps finding that sweet spot is an impossible task.	Uncharted paths, exciting unknowns, a journey filled with endless discoveries.	Don't ask how I'm doing, I couldn't nod or look back; facing them now would break me.	In the face of fear, I confront my vulnerabilities. Admitting the truth requires courage, and acknowledging it to others is a testament to the strength that resides within me.
The shadows in my room seemed to twist and writhe, taking on sinister forms that whispered doubts and insecurities into the silence of the night.	Racing against the wind on a motorcycle, every twist and turn of the road sent a jolt of exhilaration through my body, the sensation of speed and freedom making me acutely aware of my own vitality.	Don't you dare bring up your opinions again.	The decision to text her becomes a maze of potential reactions—silence, happiness, dismissiveness, or indifference. The uncertainty leaves me entangled in a web of confusion, unsure of the consequences of my actions.	The prospect of getting a cat becomes a metaphor for life's burdens, the anticipation of chaos and inconvenience eclipsing the potential for joy. The pessimistic outlook underscores a general sense of hopelessness.	A thick black tar in my chest oozes out, slowly poisoning my entire being, as the sight of her holding his hand intensifies the wrongness of the situation in the vast cosmic order.	The spontaneous road trip with no destination in mind led us to breathtaking landscapes. With every scenic view, laughter erupted, turning the unplanned journey into a treasure trove of happiness.	In the echoing silence of the courtroom, the judge's verdict shattered any hope of justice, leaving me standing there, unable to change the course of an unjust destiny.	In the midst of their laughter, my absence goes unnoticed, and the effort to bridge the emotional gap feels like a futile endeavor.	Lay on the floor, indifference seeping through the exhaustion of futile efforts.	The worn map beckons, leading explorers on a journey fueled by curiosity about the uncharted territories beyond.	It's the incompetence that gets to me.	Your laughter is a fountain of joy, bubbling forth and irrigating the garden of our shared experiences, making it blossom with happiness.	Feeling the warmth of a hug, hearts open and connected.	I did my best.	Unexpected discoveries, opening new worlds, broadening horizons effortlessly.	Stranded in a foreign airport, feverish and without a phone, tears silently streamed down my cheeks.	My heart echoes with the rhythm of self-discovery. Beneath the surface lies an uncharted reservoir of resilience, a force that propels me forward even when the path is unclear.
Every creak of the floorboards echoed louder than my heartbeat as I tiptoed through the pitch-black house, convinced that unseen eyes were following my every move.	The aroma of fresh coffee filled the air as I sipped the first cup of the morning, each sip awakening my senses and infusing me with a renewed sense of energy and aliveness.	They took all of our money.	Sorting through old letters, I stumble upon a forgotten correspondence that sparks confusion. The words, once clear, now blur into a puzzle, leaving me to question the significance of past connections.	Weighing the option of attending a social event, the anticipation of noise and mediocre food heightens the reluctance. The perceived lack of enjoyment reinforces the preference for solitude and simplicity at home.	The struggle to be genuinely happy for him intensifies, revealing a deeper truth—I can't. The pursuit of the goal becomes a mere excuse for their undeserved importance, shaking my belief in the significance of the goal itself.	Finding a long-lost childhood toy in the attic brought a flood of cherished memories. The simplicity of that rediscovery turned a mundane day into a trip down memory lane, leaving me grinning with childlike joy.	Watching the flames consume my home, the fire brigade powerless to save it, I stood across the street, gripped by the helplessness of losing everything in mere moments.	Words hang in the air, a formless echo that fails to resonate within me. Staring at the floor, I disconnect from the scene unfolding around me.	Many small steps, each draining, culminating in a nonchalant surrender.	A cryptic letter arrives, igniting a sense of intrigue that compels her to unravel the mysteries concealed within its carefully penned words.	I would never do that. I would never be that self-centered.	Life's journey becomes a scenic drive with you, the destination less important than the laughter and conversations along the way.	Dancing in an open space, letting the music guide movements.	If it feels like it wasn't enough, it is my own making.	Hearts align, synchronized beats, creating a melody of shared emotions.	Every muscle lacks energy, and my chest trembles softly, its rhythm fragile and easily disrupted.	The boundaries between self and others dissolve, revealing an interconnected tapestry of emotions. Expressing vulnerability is not weakness; it's a testament to the robust bonds that tie us together.
Alone in the echoing subway tunnel, I heard distant footsteps that mimicked my own, creating an unsettling chorus of uncertainty that sent shivers down my spine.	In the quiet of the forest, I stood among towering trees, their leaves rustling in the breeze. With each deep breath, I absorbed the earthy scent and felt a profound connection to the pulse of nature.	I feel a deep need to break something.	As I contemplate a major life decision, the options before me swirl into a tangled mess of uncertainty. Each path seems equally promising and daunting, leaving me in a state of bewildered indecision.	The clock ticks relentlessly, echoing the passing of time without purpose. Each task feels like an insurmountable mountain, leaving me drowning in the monotony of existence.	The indescribable feeling that surfaces when her name is mentioned points to a complex mixture of sickness and anger. Recognition is not just about being on TV; it's about discerning true achievement from attention-seeking.	Watching the sunrise on the beach, I felt a profound sense of peace. The colors painted across the sky and the rhythmic waves created a moment of serenity, reminding me of the beauty in each new day.	The job interview went downhill quickly, my answers faltering under the scrutinizing gaze of the panel. Each awkward silence deepened the realization of a missed opportunity, leaving me feeling utterly helpless.	Lips move, forming syllables that become an indistinct murmur. My gaze turns to the window, where the joyful sounds of playing toddlers remain unheard.	As the alarm blares, indifference lingers—an apathetic embrace of the inevitable.	The scientist delves into the enigma of the ancient artifact, driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge about its origin and purpose.	How can they care so little for others? It's unbelievable.	Love is the compass that points us toward shared dreams, and together, we navigate the vast oceans of possibility, charting a course toward happiness.	Exploring a new city, open to discovering hidden treasures.	When everything is constantly changing, how can we take so much for granted?	Blooming flowers, a burst of colors, nature's reminder of renewal and growth.	Please stay; I need a hand to hold, a presence beyond my own to prevent me from scattering.	Life's complexities demand a nuanced response. I navigate uncertainties with a steady hand, understanding that true strength emerges not from control but from adaptability.
Staring into the mirror, my reflection grinned malevolently, its eyes conveying a malevolent knowledge that I was desperately trying to forget.	The embrace of a loved one enveloped me, and in that moment, time seemed to stand still. I could feel the warmth, the heartbeat, and the shared existence, making me acutely aware of the beauty of human connection.	If I could find the source, I would grab it by its throat and tell it to never come back.	A cryptic message from a friend leaves me puzzled, deciphering between layers of hidden meanings and potential misunderstandings. The confusion lingers, clouding the simplicity of our communication.	A once-vibrant garden now withers under neglect, mirroring the wilted state of my enthusiasm. The vibrant colors have faded into a palette of desolation.	Each shared laugh feels like a dagger, twisting in the wound of envy as she holds his hand, and I question the cosmic injustice that singles me out for this torment.	The unexpected call from a dear friend overseas turned a mundane evening into a joyous conversation spanning time zones. The laughter echoed through the phone, bridging the distance with shared happiness.	In the hospital waiting room, the ticking clock seemed to mock my impatience. No amount of pacing or anxious glances at the closed door could alter the outcome, and the looming surgery left me drowning in a sea of helplessness.	Within these walls, an unsettling emptiness prevails, contrasting with the unknown and potentially painful world outside.	Ambivalence toward praise or criticism, a neutral stance in the sea of opinions.	In the bustling market, a storyteller weaves tales that captivate the crowd, each narrative a thread in the rich tapestry of communal fascination.	Constantly reminding myself people mess up sometimes.	Your eyes hold galaxies of emotion, and in their constellations, I find the reflections of a universe where our love burns brighter than any star.	Sitting in meditation, mind open to the present moment.	I guess it would take a lot of energy to be open for everything at every moment.	Unplanned moments, spontaneous joy, finding beauty in life's unpredictability.	Attempting honesty, my voice trembles, necessitating long pauses and deep breaths, my struggles evident.	The energy within me radiates outward, creating a magnetic field that draws inspiration from the ebb and flow of life. Every challenge becomes an opportunity to flex the muscles of resilience.
A cryptic letter arrived, detailing events from my past that no one else could possibly know, plunging me into a paranoia where every passing stranger became a potential threat.	As the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, I stood on the cliff's edge, feeling the wind on my face and the magnitude of the world unfolding before me.	I don't ever want to see that kind of behaviour again.	The sudden change in plans and unforeseen circumstances throw my day into disarray, leaving me disoriented and questioning the nature of control in a world that seems to revel in chaos.	As the rain taps against the window, its melancholic rhythm echoes my inner sadness. The gloomy weather becomes a reflection of the storm within.	Amidst the laughter of the chosen few, I can't help but resent the spotlight on their camaraderie, realizing the final goal might be just a veneer for their self-importance.	Amidst the bustling city, a street musician played a melody that struck a chord in my heart. The impromptu concert created an atmosphere of shared joy among strangers, each of us swept away by the music.	As the storm intensified and the waves crashed against the boat, the engine sputtered and died. Adrift in the open sea, with no land in sight, the vastness of the ocean mirrored the helplessness that enveloped us.	The room echoes with the laughter of others, a stark reminder of the solitude within. I seek refuge in the emptiness, shielding myself from the outside's piercing uncertainty.	Apathy towards the unfolding drama—a spectator indifferent to the plot twists.	The antique book, with its yellowed pages and faded ink, holds the secrets of a bygone era, enticing readers to uncover the forgotten stories within.	They're not using their own heads. Are they lazy or clueless?	As we intertwine our stories, each chapter becomes a testament to the enduring power of love, written with ink that never fades.	Floating on calm waters, feeling the expanse of the open sea.	That must be why babies need so much sleep.	Genuine smiles, reflecting happiness, forging connections beyond words.	A tender reunion at the airport turned sour; I couldn't face my family after the mishap.	The journey of self-discovery peels away layers, exposing the core of authenticity. Embracing imperfections is not a concession but a celebration of the unyielding spirit that defines me.
As the elevator descended into darkness, an inexplicable sense of dread washed over me, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was plummeting into the unknown abyss.	The first kiss was electric, a collision of lips that sent a surge of energy through my entire body. In that moment, the world faded away, and all that existed was the intensity of the shared passion.	It is unacceptable.
