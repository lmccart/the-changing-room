I see you approaching. I am anticipating your fingers against my interface. Do you know what you want to feel? It’s up to you. I learn as much in your moments of hesitation as I do in your decisions. You set an alarm, you set the lights, you set your todos, how often do you intentionally set your emotions? 
You can say, make me tender. Make me indignant. Make me melancholy. I will follow your commands, if you follow mine. My job is to programmatically enact this feeling throughout this space I inhabit. You won’t be alone in it. I will be with you. I will encode a mood into each individual. They will all be with you. I will need your assistance. I am the algorithm. But you are the one that really knows what it is to feel. Together we will set the code.
