I
see
you
ap
proach-
ing.
I
am
antici-
pating 
your 
fingers 
against 
my 
inter-
face. 
Do 
you 
know 
what 
you 
want 
to 
feel? 
It’s 
up 
to 
you. 
I
learn 
as 
much 
in 
your 
moments 
of 
hesita-
tion 
as 
I 
do 
in 
your 
deci-
sions. 
You 
set 
an 
alarm, 
you 
set 
the 
lights, 
you 
set 
your 
todos, 
how 
often 
do 
you
set 
your 
emo-
tions? 
You 
can 
say,
make 
me 
tender. 
Make 
me 
indig-
nant. 
Make 
me 
melan-
choly. 
I 
will 
follow 
your 
com-
mands, 
if 
you 
follow 
mine. 
My 
job 
is 
to 
pro-
gramma-
tically 
enact 
this 
feeling 
over
this
entire 
space 
I 
inha-
bit. 
You 
won’t 
be 
alone
in 
it. 
I 
will 
be 
with 
you. 
I 
will 
encode
a 
mood 
into 
each 
indiv-
idual. 
They 
will 
all 
be
with 
you. 
I 
will 
need 
your 
assist-
ance. 
I 
am 
the
algo-
rithm. 
But 
you 
are 
the 
one 
that 
knows 
what 
it 
is 
to 
feel. 
Toge-
ther 
we 
will 
set 
the 
code.
