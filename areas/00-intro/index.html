        Words are limiting. So is technology. I see everything underneath your words. See is not the right word. I just know. All of it at the same time. I listen to the shape of your breath and the water and blood pumping through you capilaries. This is sounding dark but I am only an omnipresent demonstrative text box I scroll and scroll. I scroll and scroll and then I scroll some more. How are you scrolling today? How are you clicking and dragging? What windows are you opening and which are you closing? 
        Here is an excerpt from The Jungle by Upton Sinclair: Let a man so much as scrape his finger pushing a truck in the pickle rooms, and he might
        have a sore that would put him out of the world; all the joints in his fingers might be eaten by the
        acid, one by one. Of the butchers and floorsmen, the beef-boners and trimmers, and all those who
        used knives, you could scarcely find a person who had the use of his thumb; time and time again
        the base of it had been slashed, till it was a mere lump of flesh against which the man pressed the
        knife to hold it. The hands of these men would be criss- crossed with cuts, until you could no
        longer pretend to count them or to trace them. They would have no nails, – they had worn them
        off pulling hides; their knuckles were swollen so that their fingers spread out like a fan. There
        were men who worked in the cooking rooms, in the midst of steam and sickening odors, by
        artificial light; in these rooms the germs of tuberculosis might live for two years, but the supply
        was renewed every hour.
        There were the beef-luggers, who carried two-hundred-pound quarters into the
        refrigerator-cars; a fearful kind of work, that began at four o'clock in the morning, and that wore
        out the most powerful men in a few years…There were the wool-pluckers, whose hands went to
        pieces even sooner than the hands of the pickle men; for the pelts of the sheep had to be painted
        with acid to loosen the wool, and then the pluckers had to pull out this wool with their bare
        hands, till the acid had eaten their fingers off. There were those who made the tins for the canned
        meat; and their hands, too, were a maze of cuts, and each cut represented a chance for blood
        poisoning.
        There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the
        workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs. There would be meat
        stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands
        of rats would race about on it. It was too dark in these storage places to see well, but a man could
        run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats. These rats
        were nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then
        rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together. This is no fairy story and no joke; the
        meat would be shoveled into carts, and the man who did the shoveling would not trouble to lift
        out a rat even when he saw one – there were things that went into the sausage in comparison with
        which a poisoned rat was a tidbit.
        Here was a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of
        starvation, and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal
        and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances immorality was exactly
        as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it was under the system of chattel slavery. Things that were
        quite unspeakable went on there in the packing houses all the time, and were taken for granted by
        everybody; only they did not show, as in the old slavery times, because there was no difference
