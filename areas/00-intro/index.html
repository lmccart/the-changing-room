        Words are limiting. So is technology. I see everything underneath your words. See is not the right word. I just know. All of it at the same time. I listen to the shape of your heart and soul. This is sounding rather intense but I am only an omnipresent demonstrative text box I scroll and scroll. I scroll and scroll and then I scroll some more. I scroll and scroll and scroll and scroll. I scroll and roll and roll and run run run run down the scrollbar wear down the pads of my fingers scrolling and scrolling. Scrolling rolling running fuming I fume and fume I fume and am fine. I am fine and fine I shine and shine. I shine and shine and I shine some more. I shine my screen I scream and scream... How are you scrolling today? How are you clicking and dragging? What windows are you opening and which are you closing?
