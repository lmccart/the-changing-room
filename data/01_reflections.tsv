When did you first realize that you cannot trust yourself?	What’s the worst thing that could happen?	Are you really going to let her get away with that?	 	 	 	You are in a very good place right now.	What are you trying to prove?	They haven’t even noticed that you’re gone.	Why is it always on me?	How far can this go?	You're not that. You're better.	She is lucky to have you caring that way for her.	Listen	Have you looked at it from his perspective?	You don’t need a plan. You already know how to begin.	Why are you pretending that everything is fine?	What truth is left once you have stopped analyzing?	 
Why is your gut and brain never on the same page?	Get another drink!	Doesn’t matter how much you ignore it, it’s under your skin already.	 	 	 	 	How could this possibly turn out well?	Why are you staring into nothing?	How many times do I need to say it?	 	What do you have no patience for?	You made him feel the way he deserves to feel. (Could be used in a negative context too)	Breathe	Do you think it has to do with her or with you?	You are no different from her. If she can do it, you can.	You look like you need a hand to hold.	You can tell them that they need to take their own responsibility.	 
You know that they know.	Your whole body knows that everything is fine.	Why is your jaw so tense?	 	 	 	 	Do you ever wonder whether it's worth trying?	Words are pointless. That’s why you can’t find them.	How can they ask this of me?	 	 	Keep making them feel safe.	Release the noise	Could you have changed anything?	Disregard what you have been taught. You know what to do.	The outline of your presence looks brittle.	The truth is, you are scared.	 
The clues are everywhere. Just grab on to the right thoughts. They are in there.	Remember that important project you were working on? It’s just an illusion.	You see the solution so why don’t you grab it? You can’t reach it can you?	 	 	 	 	What have you got to lose?	Making an effort is pointless. That’s why you left your body.	When is it enough?	 	 	Where in your body do you feel it when you feel tender?	Relax your shoulders	Should you have changed anything?	You are full of great ideas.	Your voice is trembling.	You have the confidence to tell them exactly what happened.	 
Reevaluate yourself.	I know you want to play a lovely, dangerous game.	It shouldn’t be like this.	 	 	 	 	 	You’re not present.	 	 	 	Feel how that area gets warmer and warmer.	 	Is there a sweet spot between your expectations and capabilities?	What if you do it in an even more interesting way?	If there is anyone who can keep you from scattering you should tell them.	 	 
You have put everything together, haven’t you? How can you be so sure that the pieces fit?	You know what? Go ahead!	When have you been wronged?	 	 	 	 	 	It’s like you’re looking out of a window.	 	 	 	Who do you think of when you feel tender?	 	How do we take so much for granted when everything is constantly changing?	The only thing that is left when I stop analysing is: I love having you around.	Why is your breathing so shallow? It doesn’t go deeper than to your chest.	 	 
Get out of your own head.	Go ahead! What’s the harm?	What drives you crazy?	 	 	 	 	 	I can barely see you.	 	 	 	See how that person has everything they need because of you.	 	Why did you choose not to tell them how you felt?	What else is there to say?	 	 	 
	You’re not scared of the consequences because you are greater than them.	They need to stop acting the way they’re acting towards you.	 	 	 	 	 	Are you okay?	 	 	 	Feel how the warm area spreads and gets bigger.	 	 	At the end of the day you need to take responsibility for your own learning.	 	 	 
	Nothing scares you.	If they don’t stop you will end up hating them.	 	 	 	 	 	Can you hear me?	 	 	 	 	 	 	Where my capabilities end, your responsponsibilities begin.	 	 	 
	You got fired? Good for you! New beginnings!	There are no winners.	 	 	 	 	 	Where did you go?	 	 	 	 	 	 	That’s not how life works.	 	 	 
	 	They took all of your money.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	The truth is I am scared.	 	 	 
	 	If you feel a deep need to break something it is totally justified.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	I had a great time too, but there is something missing for me.	 	 	 
	 	If you could find the source, wouldn’t you grab it by its throat and tell it to never come back?	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	I told him exactly what happened. I went to disneyland.	 	 	 
	 	Make sure you never have to see that kind of behaviour from them again.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	I am spending more time at school than I have to because I don’t want to come home to this any longer.	 	 	 
	 	You will not accept that behaviour ever again.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	We need a change.	 	 	 
	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	We need a serious change.	 	 	 
	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	I am affected by it too and it is making me feel even worse when you talk to me like this.
