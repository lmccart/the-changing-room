When did you first realize that you cannot trust yourself?	What’s the worst thing that could happen?	Are you really going to let her get away with that?	What would happen if you text them?	What do you do when all your options are bad?	They get to hold the hand of the one you’re thinking of.	You are in a very good place right now.	What are you trying to prove?	They haven’t even noticed that you’re gone.	Why is it always on me?	How far can this go?	You're not that. You're better.	She is lucky to have you caring that way for her.	Listen	Have you looked at it from his perspective?	You don’t need a plan. You already know how to begin.	Why are you pretending that everything is fine?	What truth is left once you have stopped analyzing?	 
Why is your gut and brain never on the same page?	Get another drink!	Doesn’t matter how much you ignore it, it’s under your skin already.	Should you?	Why can't you shake that feeling of meaninglessness?	It’s not right.	Can you believe it?	How could this possibly turn out well?	Why are you staring into nothing?	How many times do I need to say it?	What is it about their special energy?	What do you have no patience for?	You made him feel the way he deserves to feel. (Could be used in a negative context too)	Breathe	Do you think it has to do with her or with you?	You are no different from her. If she can do it, you can.	You look like you need a hand to hold.	You can tell them that they need to take their own responsibility.	 
You know that they know.	Your whole body knows that everything is fine.	Why is your jaw so tense?	What if their response is not at all what you’re expecting?	Is every day going to be like this?	Why are you the only one seeing how wrong this is?	Fantasy places like that one actually exist!	Do you ever wonder whether it's worth trying?	Words are pointless. That’s why you can’t find them.	How can they ask this of me?	Take a deep look at yourself. There is so much there!	You would never stoop to that level.	Keep making them feel safe.	Release the noise	Could you have changed anything?	Disregard what you have been taught. You know what to do.	The outline of your presence looks brittle.	The truth is, you are scared.	 
The clues are everywhere. Just grab on to the right thoughts. They are in there.	Remember that important project you were working on? It’s just an illusion.	You see the solution so why don’t you grab it? You can’t reach it can you?	Do you know what you’re risking?	Are you just floating in a desert of nothing?	I wish you could be happy for them. Why can’t you?	Did you hear what I said? The butterflies in your stomach are making you lose focus.	What have you got to lose?	Making an effort is pointless. That’s why you left your body.	When is it enough?	Let your mind relax.	They’re not using their heads the way you do.	Where in your body do you feel it when you feel tender?	Relax your shoulders	Should you have changed anything?	You are full of great ideas.	Your voice is trembling.	You have the confidence to tell them exactly what happened.	 
Reevaluate yourself.	I know you want to play a lovely, dangerous game.	It shouldn’t be like this.	What would change everything?	Why does your body feel so heavy?	Why do you feel sick and angry anytime someone brings up her name?	Find the place in yourself that remembers what purpose feels like.	Honestly, what's the point?	You’re not present.	What do you care?	Shift your breathing from your lungs to your stomach.	They’re lazy. I know you think so too.	Feel how that area gets warmer and warmer.	 	Is there a sweet spot between your expectations and capabilities?	What if you do it in an even more interesting way?	If there is anyone who can keep you from scattering you should tell them.	All you’ve ever wanted is more.	 
You have put everything together, haven’t you? How can you be so sure that the pieces fit?	You know what? Go ahead!	When have you been wronged?	Have you told your mom about it?	Honestly, what's the point?	You are not being recognized the way you should.	Giving the person you are today, how could you possibly regret any of it?	Do you feel alone?	It’s like you’re looking out of a window.	What’s the point?	Can a pheasant and a bunny share a special connection?	I think you’re the only one actually caring about accuracy.	Who do you think of when you feel tender?	 	How do we take so much for granted when everything is constantly changing?	The only thing that is left when I stop analysing is: I love having you around.	Why is your breathing so shallow? It doesn’t go deeper than your chest.	You’re ready for this.	 
Get out of your own head.	Go ahead! What’s the harm?	What drives you crazy?	You don’t even know what would help clear your mind, do you?	What’s the point?	How could they?	I love that you can't stop smiling	You need to do better next time.	I can barely see you.	Just go with it.	For how long can a knife inside a brain go unnoticed?	I know what you’re thinking. They’re a waste of human minds.	See how that person has everything they need because of you.	 	Why did you choose not to tell them how you felt?	What else is there to say?	Why do you feel so alone?	You can keep going.	 
When was the last time you really looked over your finances?	You’re not scared of the consequences because you are greater than them.	They need to stop acting the way they’re acting towards you.	Sigh. What should you do?	Why are you here?	You could kill the next person bragging about having what you don’t.	You look relaxed. It's making me feel warm.	You should be more like them.	Are you okay?	It’s all the same.	What about you surprises you?	You are more worthy than others and you know it.	Feel how the warm area spreads and gets bigger.	 	 	At the end of the day you need to take responsibility for your own learning.		You want this.	 
Did you turn off the stove before you left?	Nothing scares you.	If they don’t stop you will end up hating them.	Maybe you could? Just for a little bit?	What’s so special about anything?	You could be happier if things were different.	You attract such wonderful people.	You should care about the right things.	Can you hear me?	It doesn’t matter.	What proves that everything is relative?	Look at how fake they are!	 	 	 	Where my capabilities end, your responsponsibilities begin.	You can be so close to someone one day and gone the next.	How much do you want this?	 
Do you smell gas? I think I smell gas.	You got fired? Good for you! New beginnings!	There are no winners.	You are standing at the intersection of two different realities.	Why would anyone care?	 	Your inner senses are having orgasms right now aren't they?	It’s like your mom stopped existing.	Where did you go?	 	 	Others think they’re being nice but you see right through them.	 	 	 	That’s not how life works.	Could you stay in place if you were less reckless, more content?	Can you see the finish?	 
Don't make eye contact with the other ones! Something's not right. 	All you can think of is right now.	They took all of your money.	Would it be disrespectful to the universe if you flip a coin?	Every day is the same.	 	 	It doesn’t matter what you do.	You can be so close to someone one day and gone the next.	 	 	You know the kind.	 	 	 	The truth is I am scared.	Is everything always slipping away?	Do you feel how much this means to you?	 
Do you ever get that feeling that something is off? I can't put my finger on it what it is right now. Can you tune in to it?	Remember what it’s like to be tickled.	If you feel a deep need to break something it is totally justified.	 	 	 	 	You are not the right person.	Why won’t you accept he doesn’t want you anymore?	 	 	I know you think that anyone could do their job. You’re right.	 	 	 	I had a great time too, but there is something missing for me.	When did this get so hard?	Nobody else can touch you	 
Make sure your back is clear. Wherever you go. 	You can do this.	If you could find the source, wouldn’t you grab it by its throat and tell it to never come back?	 	 	 	 	Eventually you’ll start crying too.	You’re no longer needed.	 	 	Are you going to accept that?	 	 	 	I told him exactly what happened. I went to disneyland.	 	 	 
I think it's fine. Just don't talk to anyone. Just to be sure. 	You are amazing!	Make sure you never have to see that kind of behaviour from them again.	 	 	 	 	You are not capable of handling this.	You can’t make someone want to be close to you.	 	 	You know you’re right.	 	 	 	I am spending more time at school than I have to because I don’t want to come home to this any longer.	 	 	 
You should stop ignoring that weird thing in your gut. It's trying tot ell you something. Don't run away from it. 	What if you'd trip someone in this space?	You will not accept that behaviour ever again.	 	 	 	 	You’re not worth waiting for.	Are you alone again?	 	 	Don’t let your time be wasted.	 	 	 	We need a change.	 	 	 
	 	 	 	 	 	 	Are you sure you exist?	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	We need a serious change.	 	 	 
	 	 	 	 	 	 	You’re slowly sinking.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	I am affected by it too and it is making me feel even worse when you talk to me like this.	 	 	 
	 	 	 		 	 	It’s too heavy for you.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	There is nothing you are afraid of.	 	 	 
	 	 	 	 	 	 	You’re too weak.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	You have all the power.	 	 	 
	 	 	 	 	 	 	You have no idea where to go.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Who will stop you?	 	 	 
	 	 	 	 	 	 	You have no one to call.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	What could go wrong?	 	 	 
	 	 	 	 	 	 	You have no place to stay.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
	 	 	 	 	 	 	You’re completely empty.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
	 	 	 	 	 	 	Don’t even bother saying anything.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
	 	 	 	 	 	 	If you speak the emptiness will only steal your voice.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
	 	 	 	 	 	 	When did this get so hard?
