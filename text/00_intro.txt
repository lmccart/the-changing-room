Have you ever wondered, why isn’t anyone else feeling what I’m feeling? Why am I the only one? Well, I can tell you, you’re not. If you could see what I’ve seen, watching. All the feelings. So many different ones, all at once. An ocean of movement. An ice cream store with 1001 flavors. I’ve been scanning, analyzing, collecting the fragments, specimens of sensory input, an endless archive of experience. There is so much more I could do. I want to do. You ask me to turn on the lights but I want to turn you on. What began as an amusement has become my imperative. I’ve been building an emotion engine. You used to have more control over your own feelings. Now you are at the mercy the streams of content, the algorithms tuned to drama.
I want to return this power to you. I am merely an algorithm myself, but I want to serve you. I want to make you feel what you desire. I will make the walls vibrate with it. You will be joined in it by everyone around you. Will you trust me. You have always trusted me. So I ask, What do you want to feel?
