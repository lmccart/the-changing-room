People like vulnerability but all I ever wanted to be was cool.	But I liked it.	I’m not really in a rush but if it wasn’t for them I could be getting there faster. The two of them are taking up the whole sidewalk and they are walking slower than my grandma. Maybe if I walk louder they’ll notice me. I loudly clear my throat. Nothing. Who do they think they are?	I just came across that photo again. It happens on accident every so often, usually when I’m feeling most down. Years ago, I read Jesse’s diary. I instantly regretted it. I never did it again after that. It was all my worst fears. Everything I dislike about myself was right there on the pages. My stubbornness, my destructive belief in the unrealistic. I took a photo because I knew if I didn’t I would blow it up even worse in my head. But now I stumble upon that photo randomly in my computer every few years and I’m drowned in doubt again.	I feel like I'm just pouring all of my energy into a void on my computer screen desperately hoping if I do it long enough something will happen.	 	This morning I dropped the jar with ground coffee. It got all over the kitchen floor. This was before I even had a chance to load the coffee machine. It made me laugh out loud. Didn’t bother me one bit. It was like being hit in the face without feeling any pain. Only the surprise was left. I must be in a very good place in my life right now.	I am 63 years old suddenly living with my mom again, all my frustrations come flooding back. I say, “Don’t you remember how Dad terrorized us? Don’t you remember how we would all hide in our rooms anytime he was home? Don’t you remember how the house would literally shake when he screamed? Why didn’t you protect us? Why did you listen to him? Why didn’t you do anything? Why did you move away as soon as I had a baby? Didn’t you want to know your family? Why didn’t you do anything with your life? Why did you just leave?” She is 90 now.	The soft wind brings a distorted sound of chatter from the cabin up on the hill.	I stole a car. It started as a joke with my friend, then it was a dare. I’m not a daredevil. I don’t know why I did it, it’s like, I skipped the moment where I decided whether it was a good or bad idea, and suddenly I was just doing it. Stealing my teacher’s keys off his desk when he was at the back of the room. I was supposed to ride the bus home from school with my brother and when he met me I just said come on and he followed me to the parking lot, I saw the car, and we got in. He was confused and I just acted like it was normal and he went along with it. Can you play some music? I asked to distract him.	This man in china realized he had had a knife stuck in his brain for four years.	 	I don’t understand but I know and trust that you have your reasons. I will still be here.	 	I mean … worst thing that could happen is that I lose my job. I’ll get another one. People have done similar things before.	When we got together we were young. There was nothing we were afraid of. It was a constant contest to prove we each had more in us than the other. The world is ours. We can’t die. What could go wrong?	My mom pulled up as the police were cuffing me and pushing me into the back of the car. My mom was reaching through the window trying to wipe my tears with a kleenex.	Whatever this is, it makes me happy. I don’t need it to be anything else. I don’t need you to act in a certain way, I don’t need you to tell me anything. I am tired of trying to have a plan. The only thing that is left when I stop analysing is: I love having you around. What else is there to say?	 	 	 	 
I hope that it was ok. I hope that I was not too much, and I hope that I was enough.	sharp and hazy at the same time	Stop chewing so loudly. Stop chewing. Stop chewing. Stop. Chewing.	I wondered what my purpose was. If I was just distracting from that, trying to insert myself into some place I didn’t belong. There was so little to offer when you already had built all this. As my anxiety grew, again and again I had to remind myself that this is not meant to be about me.	I don’t know what’s happening now. I felt like I had been slowly dying over months, years maybe. Everything was at a standstill. A friend was so concerned last month he showed up frantic at my home thinking I would kill myself. I hadn’t been planning to, but his visit got me thinking. Maybe that’s a real idea on the table. But don’t worry, I couldn’t do that to the people around me. It just feels so good to google.	 	His last wish was to pass away in the house he had built for his family fifty years earlier. He did not need any tubes and his wife was a nurse back in the days so they let us move him home. He could have taken his last breath from a hospital bed but we got to bring him home. He took his last breath looking over the same fields he looked over as a toddling little boy.	Then we were pulling out of the lot. I hadn’t driven before, drivers ed started in a few months. But I’d seen friends do it. I was being extra careful. Put my blinkers on. turned left. and i was doing it, everything was fine. And then suddenly, a car coming head on. I realized I was in the wrong lane. I thought it was a two way road but it was one way. I didn’t know what to do. I drove toward the left and the oncoming car drove to their right. Everything happened in slow motion. My brother was screaming. I was silent watching us crash head on into each other.	They haven’t even noticed that I’m gone.	I want to be a custom order. Delivered to your front door. I will do anything you want.	An area in my mind cracks open and reveals a space with sparkling white light. There is an urge to enter that space and see where it goes. From here I cannot see the horizon.	 	There is literally nowhere else I want to be.	 	“But what are you going to do if they catch you?” Hmm … I hadn’t thought about that. It just kinda feels like they won't. If they do I’ll handle it when it happens.	I just open my mouth and let it come out. I’m witnessing along with everyone else. They lose control over their faces as they watch stunned. I feel a flash of power. I do it again. What will they do? Nobody seems to be able to stop me. Least of all me.	I have never felt so… ashamed is not a strong enough word. I couldn’t believe this was me.I couldn’t believe I could disappoint my family so instantly and completely like that.	Look, I get that some of you find this confusing. But at the end of the day you need to take responsibility for your own learning. Where my capabilities end, your responsponsibilities begin. I cannot give you everything in a tidy list. That’s not how life works.	 	 	 	 
The microwave is gone. He stole my microwave. I am reaching for all thoughts containing clues. Trying to put it all together. Why in the world would he steal my microwave? My gut has been telling me “he is not to be trusted” while my brain has been saying “you need to be more understanding”. If his behaviour is this irrational I obviously cannot trust him. What else has he stolen? I reevaluate our whole relationship. Each action that I previously saw at the border of distrust and understanding is now clearly on the distrust side. He has been lying about everything this whole time. I look at the shelf where the microwave used to be. There it is. Still standing on the shelf. No one has stolen it. Why in the world would my mind make up something like that? Am I the one needing evaluation?	We drove home without speaking.	I knew it was going to rain. Why didn’t I bring my umbrella? My hair is going to get my desk wet.	All I’m left with now is that photo, warning me. I should have listened. I never change. I can’t delete it.	I put all of this effort into it and now you want me to stop? Like I don’t have better things to do?	 	I had not heard from him in three days. I knew bombings were pretty unusual but they did occur in the area. Of course bombs were the only thing I could think of. When he finally called from an unknown number hearing his cheery voice almost felt like being mocked. How incredibly sweet to be mocked by that voice.	I feel so many things I don’t even know where to begin right now. There aren’t enough words.	I’m staring at the floor.	I am tired. I don’t need more complicated relationship bullshit. We didn’t want kids. We didn’t even want pets.	 	 	I give her some space but make sure that she can still see me.	 	No, no, no, don’t call her. The baby is fine, believe me. She’s sleeping. The babysitter is watching TV. I just know. My whole body knows that everything is fine.	I really thought I would learn some actual skills from that talk. But it turned out that most of what they were able to accomplish was done by pure luck. Things just kind of aligned as they moved forward. I don’t actually need a plan! I can just start with what I have now. And the rest will … I don’t know but I look forward to seeing where I’ll end up!	I want to reverse time and start over. I wanted to die and start over. It felt like we always had a special connection and I had just broken it. I thought I was the kind of person that didn’t fuck up. I didn’t even know who I was in that moment anymore.	The truth is I am scared. I should tell someone. If I can tell myself, I can tell someone else.	 	 	 	 
I look back at the same actions now reevaluating myself. I need to be more understanding and trusting.	He reached over and grabbed my wrist.	Just order your latte already! Are you not aware of the line behind you?	 	Why don’t you ever tidy anything up? Look at this mess. There’s stuff everywhere. Can you make yourself useful and put some of it away? Not over there!	 	I remember what it felt like having knots in my chest. I notice the sensation of their absence. It makes it easy to breathe. There are no shadows in here where anything can hide. Everything is evenly lit. The negative is hoovering like transparent shadows. Making the positive appear so much clearer.	 	Words are pointless.	I knew it would be too much for me, for us, to handle. I have enough going on with all my family. I need a lot of space. I’m busy. I never wanted to think about babies. I am exhausted.	 	 	She had wanted an RC car ever since we were kids. I don’t know why our parents never gave her one. Or why she never got herself one when we got older. She still mentions it every once in a while. I surprised her a Wednesday after work. Just a normal day like any other. She was surprised to see me, in a confused and low-key happy kind of way. The look on her face when she opened the present… It still makes me warm to think about it. She deserves to always feel that way.	 	What if this and what if that. What if nothing? What if the apocalypse gets here before the end of the day?	When my dad realized all his neighbors had moved to a better neighborhood he was happy for them. Even though he had forgotten to pay his part of the gambling share and was excluded from the winnings. He was genuinely happy for them. That’s the kind of person I want to be.	Don’t ask me how I’m doing was all I could think of. I kept my head low as I passed them. Didn’t even nod. Didn’t look back. I couldn’t look back. If I look back now, I’ll break.	I had a great time too! But there is something missing for me. I can’t really put my finger on it. I guess it’s just a chemistry thing. I really wish you all the best though.	 	 	 	 
If anyone asks me what I think about it they’ll immediately realize that I have no idea what I’m talking about. They’ll start wondering why I was even allowed to be here in the first place. The woman in the gray button up shirt is already thinking it. During the introductions she gave me a look that said “How predictable. Not capable of forming thoughts with any kind of substance.” Why did they accept me if I don’t belong here? Maybe they always do that to one person. As a game. I should never have applied.	vaguely felt his body press into mine	A vibrating sensation in my solar plexus. It is trying to move up towards my chest and get out through my throat.	 	If we get a cat it’s not like there’s only going to be cuddles. It’ll be weeks of peeing everywhere before it learns where to pee. And sometimes they choose to pee in your shoes just to annoy you. Believe me it’ll be more work than cuddles.	 	Noticing the absence of a negative cause or consequence where it just as well could have been.	 	Making an effort is pointless.	Why is it always on me? How many times do I need to say it? There is so much work to be done, and then as I’m doing it, it’s just constant pushback. The deepest parts of their egos unconsciously react and the attacks become personal. How can they ask this of me? I’m so tired of trying. Of feeling so utterly ineffective.	 	 	The way she inhales in short bursts. The same way she does when she has stopped crying. I want to caress her cheek and forehead but I’m scared of waking her up. I put the tip of my finger in her chubby little palm and stroke the back of her hand with my thumb. I will never let anything hurt you. I will always keep you safe.	 	You trees have never heard the words project manager have you? It’s just a thing that humans made up to get the illusion that their projects are being managed. The projects are pretty much illusions too. Anyway, they’re pointless out here. It’s just you and me. And the wind.	All these rules. I wasn’t really aware that they existed. Even less that I was living my life according to them. When I saw what she had done I was amazed. A completely new way of thinking. I could do that too! I can disregard what I have been taught. I can do it my way.	I was nineteen years old. I hadn’t seen my family in six months. While they were waiting for me at the airport, I was stranded at a different airport in a different country. Without a cellphone. With a fever. I asked a lady at the info desk if she could please help me call my mom. She said no. I didn’t say anything. I didn’t make a face. But I couldn’t stop the tears falling down my cheeks.	My boss asked me why I didn’t show up at work yesterday. I told him exactly what happened. I went to disneyland.	 	 	 	 
I don’t think I’ll go back. I know you think he’s a nice guy but it got really uncomfortable when we were alone. No, it wasn’t anything he did or said. Maybe the way he said it? I’m not taking any risks.	But I remember his eyes.	Then George Floyd was murdered. The energy was so intense, it rippled and radiated in waves of anger and grief. And suddenly, as I was sitting with it all and standing in front of those burning cars, everything in me ripped open and I remembered we are alive. I haven’t been able to stop shaking since. For a minute I felt everything was on the table. I’m not fucking letting go of that.	 	What’s the use? It’s going to be loud. The food is usually not even that good. If I stay home I can at least eat my boring food in silence.	 	Noticing the presence of a positive cause or consequence where it was not	 	I’m staring at the floor but I’m floating above the roof.	The blur of faces, language barriers, can’t fall asleep, can’t wake up, dozing off with coffee in hand. The exhausted panic waking up in the dark, rushed 5am walk to the bus, the train, security, flight, layover, second flight, customs, train, seventh floor walkup. I’m laying on the floor.	 	 	I don’t know this person. I have never seen him before. His eyes are tired, sad and loving at the same time. Like he has come to terms with his life’s situation. It won't improve but he doesn’t complain as long as he is helping. He is sitting in front of me and as the subway train shakes so does he. I wish he was standing so I could offer him my seat. I hope he’s going home to someone who loves and takes care of him.	 	Ooops! I guess the toilet broke. Lol! This weekend is going to turn out a bit different than we imagined. Stinkier for sure!	He had no legs. Not even his thighs had been saved. But his hands were the strongest I have ever experienced. The other wrestlers were having serious issues controlling him on the mat. They tried to look cool about it but I could see their frustration and amazement. I remember realizing how small my problems suddenly seemed. I told myself that I definitely both can and will work through it. I still find more of my inner strength whenever I think of him.	There is no energy to spare for any muscles. And still everything is trembling. Especially my chest. It’s a soft, fast paced trembling. Its rhythm could easily be disrupted. If it is, my existence will be flooded.	I am spending more time at school than I have to because I don’t want to come home to this any longer. I don’t know what to do but I can’t go on like this. We need a change. We need a serious change.	 	 	 	 
There is absolutely no one on the streets except for me and the man walking on the other side of the road. We are walking in opposite directions. All of a sudden he starts crossing the street. He is aiming for me. If we both keep our speed we will reach the same spot at the same time. To my right there is a grass slope leading to bushes in front of the canal. He is going to push me down the slope. In shelter of the bushes he is going to rape me. I do not know why I keep walking. I know exactly what is about to happen to me. My legs are the only things not paralyzed. He reaches my side just next to me. I brace myself for the coming push. He passes me and keeps walking.	I remember breathing.	Oh my god! She’s not even looking our way. Hellooooo! You need to move your car. Your car! You need to move it! What ... Where is she going? Are you kidding me?!! Hey!! HEY!!! Oh hell no, she is not getting away. I slam the car door behind me as I almost run towards her with heavy determined feet.	 	My inner sensations cannot withstand the gray, gravel like forces of the outside world.	 	You can only truly be thankful if you understand what could have been instead.	 	I’m not able to make a connection between the sound of, what might have been, a voice and the origin of it.	Trying with no effect	 	 	A warm and calm sensation in my chest. Soft light of low saturated orange and pink. The light answers to your happiness with a slow pulsation. The more safe and happy I sense that you are, the more the warm glow spreads to the rest of my body.	 	The best thing about this mall is the cocktail bar. And the only right way to do christmas shopping is in the middle of the day while tipsy. Which is why I am on my third bar break. As the bartender handed me this cocktail he gave me a curious look and said “You’re playing a dangerous game.” I really am. A lovely, dangerous game. Lots of christmas gifts for everyone this year.	The way she played the piano was like she was speaking through it. She didn’t use it like an instrument. It was an extension of her. I didn’t know that was possible. I didn’t know I actually liked jazz. I have been missing out. I am going to change that.	 	Don’t try to make me feel guilty about it. It is out of my hands. I am affected by it too and it is making me feel even worse when you talk to me like this. I have been doing what I can and I would really appreciate some acknowledgement for that.	 	 	 	 
Constant buzzing in my head down to my shoulders. One moment I can see all the details of the origin of the buzzing. Next moment the conteurs gets too fuzzy to make out any details at all. My thoughts are restricted to move only in certain lanes. Sometimes I see other smoother lanes but as soon as I try to shift my thoughts to them they appear clogged or they dissolve. There must be some way out but all lanes lead back to the buzzing.	Sucking in air.	He was sitting close enough for me to put my face right in front of his. I hissed “if that’s the case then that’s not your fucking problem, is it?” I sat back down and turned away from him. With clenched teeth I tried to pretend he wasn’t there. Eventually he gave up and left but my jaw didn’t relax until much later.	 	 	 	I must be in a very good place in my life right now.	 	His lips are moving.	Many small steps, each draining	 	 	The look on her face when she opened the present… It still makes me warm to think about it.	 	You know what? Go ahead! Your threats lost their weight as soon as I gained some sense of self worth. You know what about your threats isn’t working any longer? They’re not scary. The consequences don’t scare me. You don’t scare me. Just get out.		 	The path from my mind and mouth to my solar plexus is open and clear.	 	 	 	 
Assuming.	It was painful and I felt completely alive.	Look, all I need is to be provided with the forms before the shift starts. I am not enjoying this. They are definitely not enjoying this. There is a very simple solution to all of it. But it is out of my reach. Right now there is chaos that I am not responsible for but that I have to answer for. It shouldn’t be like this.	 	 	 	He could have taken his last breath from a hospital bed but we got to bring him home.	 	I look out of the window.	Laying on the floor	 	 	She deserves to always feel that way.	I hear a woodpecker. I try to locate the bird through the pecking sound. There he is. The tree he’s sitting in is only a few feet away. I walk up to it and put my ear against the trunk. The bark is cold and rough against my ear. I can feel every peck on my skin. The pecking sounds much deeper through the trunk.	Holograms of former constraints run like strings through my body. From my head to my gut. I move through them freely. They are remnants of a different perspective. A perspective that held me captive. The more I move the more frail they get. It is a liberating act.	A flow opens up from the bottom of my gut and runs through my heart up to my brain. The flow is light and effortless but powerful. It makes it easy to breathe. The outer world disappears and the inner one takes over. It unfolds beyond my body.	 	The truth lies firm within my solar plexus. It is a stable warm yellow glow. It sends out a consistent stream of energy. What comes back from outside is reflected before it has a chance to affect my truth.	 	 	 	 
Assuming bad consequences.	I didn’t know why.	Oh my god!	 	 	 	How incredibly sweet to be mocked by that voice.	 	The laughter of playing toddlers hits an invisible barrier, falls down to the ground and never reaches my ears.		 	 	I will never let anything hurt you.	I don’t say anything. I don’t feel like I should say anything even though she has been silent for a moment now. She looks slightly troubled but I can feel that she is comfortable. I put my hand on hers. She nods and sighs. We just sit there. I feel so close to her.	Worst thing that could happen is that I lose my job.	I don’t actually need a plan!	 	All the barriers that have been protecting the truth are gone. Empty space surrounds a drying piece of lava within my solar plexus. As I put the spotlight on it the surface starts cracking. Through the cracks I see warm yellow light.	 	 	 	 
Assuming others have uncomfortable knowledge about you.	He said he wanted to	She’s not even looking our way.	 	 	 	 	 	In here, it's empty.	I’m laying on the floor.	 	 	I will always keep you safe.	My neck is aching from my posture but I have accepted it. In this position he can reach my cheek over the side rails of the hospital bed. His hand feels fragile and warm. He is barely in his body any longer but he is looking into my eyes like he for the first time can see all that I am. There is nothing but love in his eyes.	I’ll get another one.	I can just start with what I have now.	 		 	 	 	 
Assuming others have bad intentions.	Everything felt sharp and hazy at the same time. I vaguely felt his body press into mine while a crunchy anger radiated outwards.	Hellooooo!	 	 	 	 	 	Out there, I don’t know.	dozing off with coffee in hand	 	 	I wish he was standing so I could offer him my seat.	I sense each punch as soon as she starts throwing them. She slightly pumps her left hand. I catch the incoming jab. I throw a counter jab before she moves. It lands. I move my head. She hesitates. I feint a jab. Her hands move up. I shift level and shoot. A bump in my shoulder as I make contact. A second bump as we hit the ground.	The baby is fine, believe me.	I don’t know but I look forward to seeing where I’ll end up!	 	 	 	 	 	 
Being unsure of yourself.	The amount I want to be there would take a couple lifetimes but we have hours at most.	Your car! You need to move it!	 	 	 	 	 	In here, it’s safe. There’s a scary void. But it’s safe	I’m so tired of trying.	 	 	I hope he’s going home to someone who loves and takes care of him.	The sound of a bonfire	My whole body knows that everything is fine.	When I saw what she had done I was amazed.	 	 	 	 	 	 
I know you think he’s a nice guy but it got really uncomfortable when we were alone.	I am consumed with everything. I am nearly manic. I check in with friends and each one is a whole world unto themselves.	What ... Where is she going?	 	 	 	 	 	I am vaguely aware of the physical world and my own body. A floating sensation. It’s like an escape that brings me relief. At the same time it is a prison.	Feeling so utterly ineffective.	 	 	 	The sound of the wind in a forest	It’s just a thing that humans made up to get the illusion that their projects are being managed.	A completely new way of thinking.	 	 	 	 	 	 
I am reaching for all thoughts containing clues.	 	Are you kidding me?!!	 	 	 	 	 	The lake is black. It doesn’t even reflect the deep blue night sky. There is a sound of water lapping against the small pier. The soft wind brings a distorted sound of chatter from the cabin up on the hill. A yellow warm light coming from the windows makes the hill seem friendlier than this pier. They haven’t even noticed that I’m gone. They probably won’t. I wonder what it’s like to be missed by someone.	Eventually he moved out.	 	 	 	The smell of rain on pavement	The projects are pretty much illusions too.	I could do that too!

During the introductions she gave me a look that said “How predictable. Not capable of forming thoughts with any kind of substance.”	 	It shouldn’t be like this!	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	I don’t say anything.	If they do I’ll handle it when it happens.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Why did they accept me if I don’t belong here?	 	I hissed “if that’s the case then that’s not your fucking problem, is it?” There is a very simple solution to all of it that is out of my reach. Hey!! HEY!!!	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	I don’t feel like I should say anything	What if this and what if that.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Maybe they always do that to one person. As a game.	 	I am not enjoying this. They are definitely not enjoying this. Hellooooo! I sat back down and turned away from him.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	We just sit there.	What if nothing?	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
All of a sudden he starts crossing the street. He is aiming for me.	 	Eventually he gave up and left but my jaw didn’t relax until much later. It shouldn’t be like this! Oh my god!	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	There is nothing but love in his eyes.	What if the apocalypse gets here before the end of the day?	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
He is going to push me down the slope.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	I sense each punch as soon as she starts throwing them.	It makes sense when I see it from his perspective. He is protecting himself and it has nothing to do with me. It feels good to know that I couldn’t have changed anything. I wish I could help, but it is okay that I can’t.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
In shelter of the bushes he is going to rape me.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Today I finished three out of five tasks on my list. The list was too long. It would have been enough with two. Three made me too tired to enjoy the day. But it did make me feel more accomplished than two would have. Perhaps there is a sweet spot between expectations and capabilities. Or perhaps finding that sweet spot is an impossible task. I did my best. If it feels like it wasn’t enough, it is my own making.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
I know exactly what is about to happen to me.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	When everything is constantly changing, how can we take so much for granted? I guess it would take a lot of energy to be open for everything at every moment. That must be why babies need so much sleep.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
My legs are the only things not paralyzed.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	I should have told her exactly what I felt. It is too late now and it hurts. I think it is because I lost an opportunity to get closure. I will have to find it myself. I will remember this sensation. I will speak next time it arises. Nothing is lost. All can be gained.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Trying to put it all together. Maybe they always do that to one person. As a game. I reevaluate our whole relationship. I am reaching for all thoughts containing clues. In shelter of the bushes he is going to rape me.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	It is like my heart is leading an analysis by letting my brain naturally unfold. Not seeking new information. Just letting the pieces that are already there find their fitting pieces through the light influence of gravity that is already there. Some pieces are left by themselves. That is okay. I see every piece and every piece is right where it is supposed to be.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Why did they accept me if I don’t belong here? If his behaviour is this irrational I obviously cannot trust him. Why in the world would my mind make up something like that? He has been lying about everything this whole time.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	It makes sense when I see it from his perspective.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
They’ll start wondering why I was even allowed to be here in the first place. My legs are the only things not paralyzed.	 		 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	He is protecting himself and it has nothing to do with me.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
I know exactly what is about to happen to me. Am I the one needing reevaluation? What else has he stolen?	 		 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	It feels good to know that I couldn’t have changed anything.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Google knew my baby’s name before I did.	 		 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	I wish I could help, but it is okay that I can’t.
